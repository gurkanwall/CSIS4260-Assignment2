Skype is shutting down in May — these are the best alternatives,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/15/skype-shuts-down-in-may-these-are-the-best-alternatives/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us After 23 years of connecting people around the world,Skype, the popular video-calling service, isshutting down. Microsoft, the parent company, confirmed that the official sunset date for the service is May 5, 2025. Skype users can either migrate all their contacts and chat data to Microsoft Teams, or they can choose to download their Skype data and transition to another video-calling service. To assist users in the switch, we’ve created a guide on how to migrate to Teams or download Skype data. Additionally, we’ve curated a list of alternative video-calling apps that can replace Skype. Before May 5, Skype users can sign in toTeamsfor free using their Skype credentials. Once logged in, all their chats and contacts will automatically transfer to the app. Teams offers features similar to Skype, including one-on-one and group calls, messaging, and file sharing. While Skype was primarily designed for smaller groups (up to 20 participants) and casual use, Teams is more business-focused, accommodating up to 10,000 participants in a single video call. It also comes with advanced security features and various integrations, such as Evernote, OneDrive, Office 365, Salesforce, SharePoint, Trello, and more. Teams is available onAndroid,iOS,Mac, PC, and the web. For users who aren’t interested in making the transition to Microsoft Teams, we still recommend exporting account data. This ensures that valuable information — such as messages, files, and contact details — is backed up and can be accessed in the future. An obvious benefit of usingGoogle Meetis that it’s available for free with a Google account. Since a lot of people are already using Google and have existing accounts, transitioning to this platform would be fairly easy. Google Meet allows users to hold meetings with up to 100 participants, record meetings, share screens, and more. A drawback with the free plan is that if a meeting has more than three participants, there’s a 60-minute time limit. Large companies may want to purchase a Google Workspace plan for features like having up to 25 co-hosts, dividing participants into smaller breakout rooms during meetings, creating polls, setting up a Q&A session, livestreaming to YouTube, and more. Workspace — which has plans for $7/month, $14/month, $22/month, and up — also offers AI-powered tools through itsGemini assistant, which helps Meet users take notes and create custom background images. Zoomis another popular web-conferencing tool. It offers several helpful features, including the ability to host up to 100 participants and chat in both private and public groups, and has tools such as notes, a whiteboard, and screen-sharing capabilities. Users can also record meetings and access transcripts. However, one downside is the 40-minute time limit per meeting for users on the free plan. To avoid having meetings cut off, users will need to purchase a subscription, which ranges from $13/month to $18/month. Paid subscribers have access to Zoom’sAI Companion, which includes the ability to summarize meetings and ask questions about transcribed meetings. Webex, the Cisco-owned video conferencing tool, offers a similar plan to its competitors. For instance, it has features such as screen sharing, the ability to record sessions, a whiteboard capability, and more. The free plan includes up to 100 attendees per meeting, as well as an unfortunate 40-minute time limit. Webex also offers plans from $12/month, $22/month, and up, depending on team size. The paid tiers come with an AI assistant, live polling, Q&A, and the ability to add up to 1,000 attendees. Discordwas initially designed as a chat platform for gamers, but it can also serve as an alternative to Skype for personal use or for smaller teams. However, it’s not recommended for larger businesses, as it limits calls to 25 participants. On the positive side, Discord offers unlimited meeting lengths and features such as screen sharing, the ability to record meetings, and breakout rooms. The platform has a free plan in addition to two paid options priced at $5/month and $10/month, making it one of the more affordable choices available, depending on users’ needs. WhileSlackmay not be ideal for formally scheduled meetings with large groups, it can be effective for spontaneous meetings within team chats. The Huddle feature in Slack enables users to easily transition from a chat thread to an informal audio or video call with colleagues. On the free plan, Huddles can accommodate only two people, whereas paid plans (priced at $7/month or $12/month) allow for up to 50. Signal, the encrypted messaging app, has providedgroup video-calling featuressince2020and can accommodate up to 50 participants in a single call. Although it’s not a direct competitor to Skype, it allows users to share links for calls, enabling them to simply send the link to others rather than creating a group, much like Google Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams do. Notably, Signal is free to use. Other similar apps for mobile users looking to video call with smaller groups includeWhatsApp,Facebook Messenger, andApple FaceTime.

Cursor reportedly told a user going by the name “janswist” that he should write the code himself instead of relying on Cursor to do it for him. “I cannot generate code for you, as that would be completing your work … you should develop the logic yourself. This ensures you understand the system and can maintain it properly,” janswist said Cursor told him after he spent an hour “vibe” coding with the tool. So janswist fileda bug reporton the company’s product forum: “Cursor told me I should learn coding instead of asking it to generate it,” and included a screen shot. The bug report soon went viral onHacker News,and was covered byArs Technica. Janswist speculated that he hit some kind of hard limit at 750-800 lines of code, although other users replied that Cursor will write more code than that for them. One commenter suggested that janswist should have used Cursor’s “agent” integration, which works for bigger coding projects. Anysphere, maker of Cursor, couldn’t be reached for comment. But Cursor’s refusal also sounded an awful lot like the replies newbie coders could get when asking questions on programming forum Stack Overflow, folks on Hacker News pointed out. The suggestion is that if Cursor trained on that site it may have learned not just coding tips, but human snark as well.

Bluesky users debate plans around user data and AI training,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/15/bluesky-users-debate-plans-around-user-data-and-ai-training/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Social network Bluesky recentlypublished a proposal on GitHuboutlining new options it could give users to indicate whether they want their posts and data to be scraped for things like generative AI training and public archiving. CEO Jay Graberdiscussed the proposal earlier this week,while on-stage at South by Southwest, but it attracted fresh attention on Friday night, after sheposted about it on Bluesky. Some users reacted with alarm to the company’s plans, which they saw as a reversal of Bluesky’s previous insistence that itwon’t sell user data to advertisersandwon’t train AI on user posts. “Oh, hell no!” the user Sketchettewrote. “The beauty of this platform was the NOT sharing of information. Especially gen AI. Don’t you cave now.” Graberrepliedthat generative AI companies are “already scraping public data from across the web,” including from Bluesky, since “everything on Bluesky is public like a website is public.” So she said Bluesky is trying to create a “new standard” to govern that scraping, similar to therobots.txtfile that websites use to communicate their permissions to web crawlers. Debates about AI training and copyright havedragged robots.txt into the spotlight, among other things highlighting the fact that it’s not legally enforceable. Bluesky frames its proposed standard as one that would have a similar “mechanism and expectations,” providing “a machine-readable format, which good actors are expected to abide, and does carry ethical weight, but is not legally enforceable.” Under the proposal, users of the Bluesky app, or other apps that use the underlyingATProtocol, could go into their settings and allow or disallow the usage of their Bluesky data across four categories: generative AI, protocol bridging (i.e., connecting different social ecosystems), bulk datasets, and web archiving (such as the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine). If a user indicates that they don’t want their data used to train generative AI, the proposal says, “Companies and research teams building AI training sets are expected to respect this intent when they see it, either when scraping websites, or doing bulk transfers using the protocol itself.” Molly White, who writes the Citation Needed newsletter and Web3 is Going Just Great blog,described thisas “a good proposal,” and said it was “weird to see people flaming BlueSky for it,” since it’s not so much “welcoming in AI scraping” but rather “trying to add a consent signal to allow users to communicate preferences for the scraping that is already happening.” “I think the weakness with this and [Creative Commons’] similar proposal for ‘preference signals’ is that they rely on scrapers to respect these signals out of some desire to be good actors,” White continued. “We’ve already seen some of these companies blow right past robots.txt or pirate material to scrape.” Topics Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

SpaceX launches astronauts for long-awaited International Space Station crew swap,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/15/spacex-launches-astronauts-for-long-awaited-international-space-station-crew-swap/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us SpaceX successfully launched four people into space on Friday, beginning a mission that will give the International Space Station enough crew members to allow astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore to return to Earth after their nine-month stay. The mission, known as Crew-10, will see SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft dock with the International Space Station (ISS) late Saturday. The new astronauts will overlap with the existing crew for a few days before Williams and Wilmore (along with two others) return to our planet. That could happen as soon as March 19, weather permitting. SpaceX crew launches to the ISS have become routine, but this mission has been hotly anticipated because of how Williams and Wilmore got to the station in the first place — and because SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has blamed their prolonged stay on former President Joe Biden. The duo was part of the first crewed launch of Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft last June. The test mission was supposed to be a crucial milestone in Boeing’s quest to compete with SpaceX for these types of crewed launches to the ISS. Starliner was supposed to dock with the ISS for 10 days before returning Williams and Wilmore to Earth. But the spacecraft experienced leaks and thruster problems, which delayed Starliner from docking with the ISS. Starliner eventually coupled with the station and the astronauts were able to board. But Boeing and NASA spent weeks performing testing and analysis before theydecided in Augustto bring Starliner back to Earth empty. NASA and SpaceX agreed to bring the astronauts home on the next crewed mission to the ISS, Crew-9. They bumped two astronauts off that flight to accommodate the return of Williams and Wilmore. A return flight was slated for February 2025; an earlier flight would have left the ISS understaffed, according to NASA. While Williams and Wilmore have been aboard the ISS, though, Musk helped Donald Trump get elected for a second time and launched hisDepartment of Government Efficiency. Musk started saying — both on X and in interviews — that heoffered to bring the astronauts backearlier but that Biden refused because of political reasons. Musk has not provided any evidence to support this claim. NASA’s former administrator and deputy administrator under Biden havebothsaidthat no offer from Musk made it to the space agency’s headquarters.

I’m Karyne Levy, TechCrunch’s deputy managing editor, and I’ll be writing this newsletter from here on out. Thrilled to be here! This week we’re checking out everything at SXSW; Waymo’s expansion into Silicon Valley; Intel’s new CEO; TikTok’s new suitor; and why DeepSeek isn’t taking VC money. Let’s get to it! Environmental impact:The FBI, the EPA, the EPA inspector general, and the Treasury Departmentrequested that Citibank freeze accountsof several nonprofits and state government agencies. The accounts were frozen in February, but the new documents make public details that had previously been unknown until they were revealed in court filings this week. SXSW comes to an end:TechCrunch was all overSXSW in Austinthis week, riding inWaymo taxis, learningMark Cuban’s thoughts on AI(it’s a tool, not a panacea), and deciphering the T-shirt that Bluesky’s CEO wore (turns out she wastaking a swipe at Mark Zuckerberg). Intel’s new chief:Intelappointed Lip-Bu Tan as its next CEO. Tan, a Malaysia-born, longtime tech investor, formerly served as CEO of Cadence Design Systems and said that Intel will be an “engineering-focused company” under his leadership. And he’llhave his work cut out for him. This is TechCrunch’s Week in Review, where we recap the week’s biggest news. Want this delivered as a newsletter to your inbox every Saturday?Sign up here. A new era:Rad Power Bikeshas a new CEOjust a few days after its previous CEO stepped down. Kathi Lentzsch, who has spent years helping turn around underperforming companies in both the consumer and B2B spaces, will take over the e-bike company as it continues to shift away from direct-to-consumer in favor of a retail-based approach. Backdoor policies:Last month it was revealed that the U.K. government secretly ordered Apple to create a “backdoor,” allowing authorities to access the cloud-stored data of all Apple customers. U.S. lawmakers are asking the head of the U.K.’s surveillance court tohold an open hearingfor Apple’s possible challenge to the alleged secret U.K. government legal demand. Food for thought:Bryan Johnson — the investor and founder behind the Don’t Die movement —wants to start “foodome” sequencing. His goal is to test as much food as possible, creating a public database where people can donate money to have certain foods and brands tested for toxins. No parking:Waymo’s 300 driverless vehicles in San Francisco areracking up parking tickets. The cars’ 589 parking violations totaled $65,065 in fines last year. Open Sesame:AI company Sesamehas released the base model used for Maya, its super-realistic voice assistant. The model is open source, too, which means it can be used commercially. Tick tock, TikTok:TikTok’s deadline to finalize its sale to a U.S. company is just around the corner, and nowanother suitor is showing interest— Oracle. Sources told The Information that ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, is favoring Oracle over other companies. Little tech’s hero:Y Combinatorsent a letter to the White Housethis week, urging the government to support Europe’sDigital Markets Act, which aims to bust up Big Tech’s market power. It’s unclear how the White House will respond. Caviar dreams:Trump’s family has beenlooking into investing in Binance U.S.This comes just a couple of years after Binance’s U.S. arm plead guilty to violating anti-money laundering regulations. That was easy:I’m not opposed to AI, especially when it helps me be more efficient. Take, for example,a new feature that rolled out this week to Gmail. We can now add events to a Google Calendar directly from an email. That’s cool! Got him:The co-founder of Garantex, a Russian cryptocurrency exchange,was arrested in India. Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice accused Aleksej Besciokov of personally approving transactions on Garantex linked to North Korean-government hackers and other cybercriminals. Pokémon sold:Niantic, the company behind the viral sensation Pokémon GO, isselling its gaming division to Scopelyfor $3.5 billion. Niantic said it will now focus on building real-world 3D maps through a new stand-alone entity called Niantic Spatial. DeepSeek, deep pockets?Though it has tons of interest,Chinese AI company DeepSeek isn’t taking VC money— yet. Charles Rollet runs through a few reasons why. New day, new deal:OpenAI has signed afive-year, $11.9 billion agreementwith the GPU-heavy cloud service provider CoreWeave. But the amount of money isn’t the only reason why this deal is eye-popping. Before this deal, CoreWeave’s biggest customer was Microsoft. Waymo One:Waymo isexpanding its early rider programacross Silicon Valley, now offering robotaxi rides to people in Palo Alto, Mountain View, Los Altos, and parts of Sunnyvale. The new territories add to the 55 square miles of coverage already offered in the San Francisco Bay Area. Cool, cool:Fact-checking at Meta isgetting an overhaul. Starting Tuesday, the company will begin releasing its version of Community Notes for Facebook, Instagram, and Threads users in the United States. We’ve got questions:Three years after its launch, exactlyhow Lockdown Mode works is still a mystery. There’s no explanation for why it takes some of the actions it takes, and some of its notifications are super confusing. The writing’s on the wall:OpenAI’s new creative writing AI is impressivebut feels like that one kid in high school fiction clubwho tries way too hard to sound deep. While the AI can churn out clever metafiction, critics say its writing lacks real emotion and originality, making it more of a showoff than a true storyteller.

Profitable Klarna files for a potentially blockbuster IPO,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/profitable-klarna-files-for-a-potentially-blockbuster-ipo/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Swedish fintech Klarna took the next step in its highly anticipated U.S. IPO on Friday when it made itsF-1prospectus public. We are sifting through the document now. Klarna hopes to raise at least $1 billion at a $15 billion valuation with this IPO,Bloomberg reported last week.The public documents don’t yet reveal how many shares it plans to sell or the price range, so we won’t know if this IPO will meet its fundraising aspirations or not until it prices shares. That’s typically around a month, sometimes more, after the prospectus documents are made public for everyone to chew on. However, this IPO has been anticipated for years now so perhaps its bankers have some indication that investors will bite at that level. One reason could be that Klarna’s previous private valuation recentlyrebounded to $14.6 billion, according to reports, after one investor increased its stake.Another could be that Klarna is reporting a profit. Specifically, Klarna reported revenue of $2.8 billion for 2024, up from around $2.3 billion in 2023. It also reported a net profit of $21 million in 2024, a big swing from a loss in 2023 of -$244 million. Founded in 2005 by its current CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna isone of several playersthat offer buy now, pay later financing to customers for purchases. Afterlaunching in the U.S.in 2015, Klarna hit a hefty valuation ofmore than $45 billionby 2021, a figure that swiftlyplummeted by 85% to $6.5 billionwhen the 2021 venture capital valuation bubble burst. Klarna has recently been making news for developing its own in-house AI system based onOpenAI’s ChatGPTand saying that it dropped its contract for Salesforce CRM to use its internal systems instead. Siemiatkowski said its homegrown ChatGPT-powered customer service botled to replacing 700 full-time contractemployees and a savings of approximately $40 million annually. He even went so far as to say that Klarna stopped hiring aggressively because of its use of AI, letting itsworkforce dwindlefrom 5,000 in 2023 to about 3,500 by the end of 2024.

No one knows what the hell an AI agent is,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/no-one-knows-what-the-hell-an-ai-agent-is/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Silicon Valley is bullish on AI agents. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said agentswill “join the workforce” this year. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella predicted that agentswill replace certain knowledge work. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said that Salesforce’s goal is to be “the number one provider of digital labor in the world” via the company’s various “agentic” services. But no one can seem to agree on what an AI agentis, exactly. In the last few years, the tech industry has boldly proclaimed that AI “agents” — the latest buzzword — are going to change everything. In the same way that AI chatbots likeOpenAI’s ChatGPTgave us new ways to surface information, agents will fundamentally change how we approach work, claim CEOs like Altman and Nadella. That may be true. But it also depends on how one defines “agents,” which is no easy task. Much like other AI-related jargon (e.g. “multimodal,” “AGI,” and “AI” itself), the terms “agent” and “agentic” are becoming diluted to the point of meaninglessness. That threatens to leave OpenAI, Microsoft, Salesforce, Amazon, Google, and the countless other companies building entire product lineups around agents in an awkward place. An agent from Amazon isn’t the same as an agent from Google or any other vendor, and that’s leading to confusion — and customer frustration. Ryan Salva, senior director of product at Google and an ex-GitHub Copilot leader, said he’s come to “hate” the word “agents.” “I think that our industry overuses the term ‘agent’ to the point where it is almost nonsensical,” Salva told TechCrunch in an interview. “[It is] one of my pet peeves.” The agent definition dilemma isn’t new. In a piece last year, former TechCrunch reporter Ron Millerasked: What’s an AI agent? The problem he identified is that nearly every company building agents approaches the tech differently. It’s a problem that’s worsened recently. This week, OpenAIpublished a blog postthat defined agents as “automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks on behalf of users.” Yet in the same week, the company releaseddeveloper documentationthat defined agents as “LLMs equipped with instructions and tools.” Leher Pathak, OpenAI’s API product marketing lead, later said in apost on Xthat she understood the terms “assistants” and “agents” to be interchangeable — further muddying the waters. Meanwhile,Microsoft’s blogstry todistinguishbetween agents and AI assistants. The former, which Microsoft calls the “new apps” for an “AI-powered world,” can be tailored to have a particular expertise, while assistants merely help with general tasks, like drafting emails. AI lab Anthropic addresses the hodgepodge of agent definitions a little more directly. In ablog post, Anthropic says that agents “can be defined in several ways,” including both “fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods” and “prescriptive implementations that follow predefined workflows.” Salesforce has what’s perhaps the most wide-ranging definition of AI “agent.” According to the software giant,agents are“a type of […] system that can understand and respond to customer inquiries without human intervention.” The company’s website lists six different categories, ranging from “simple reflex agents” to “utility-based agents.” So why the chaos? Well, agents — like AI — are a nebulous thing, and they’re constantly evolving. OpenAI, Google, and Perplexity have just started shipping what they consider to be their first agents —OpenAI’s Operator,Google’s Project Mariner, andPerplexity’s shopping agent— and their capabilities are all over the map. Rich Villars, GVP of worldwide research at IDC, noted that tech companies “have a long history” of not rigidly adhering to technical definitions. “They care more about what they are trying to accomplish” on a technical level, Villars told TechCrunch, “especially in fast-evolving markets.” But marketing is also to blame in large part, according to Andrew Ng, the founder of AI learning platform DeepLearning.ai. “The concepts of AI ‘agents’ and ‘agentic’ workflows used to have a technical meaning,” Ng said in a recent interview, “but about a year ago, marketers and a few big companies got a hold of them.” The lack of a unified definition for agents is both an opportunity and a challenge, Jim Rowan, head of AI for Deloitte, says. On the one hand, the ambiguity allows for flexibility, letting companies customize agents to their needs. On the other, it may — and arguably already has — lead to “misaligned expectations” and difficulties in measuring the value and ROI from agentic projects. “Without a standardized definition, at least within an organization, it becomes challenging to benchmark performance and ensure consistent outcomes,” Rowan said. “This can result in varied interpretations of what AI agents should deliver, potentially complicating project goals and results. Ultimately, while the flexibility can drive creative solutions, a more standardized understanding would help enterprises better navigate the AI agent landscape and maximize their investments.” Unfortunately, if the unraveling of the term “AI” is any indication, it seems unlikely the industry will coalesce around one definition of “agent” anytime soon — if ever.

VC Aileen Lee highlights how the broader investor exodus is worsening woes for unicorn companies,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/15/vc-aileen-lee-highlights-how-the-broader-investor-exodus-is-worsening-woes-for-unicorn-companies/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In this week’s episode of theStrictlyVC Downloadpodcast, veteran VC Aileen Lee was direct about a major consequence of the recent boom-and-bust cycle: many companies stuck in limbo aren’t just struggling to regain their footing after raising too much money at unsustainable valuations; they’ve also lost the champions who once backed them. Lee was discussing how limited partners hesitate to criticize powerful fund managers, fearing they’ll be shut out from investing in those firms again. But she imagined one thing they’d say if they could speak freely: “Everybody wants to get into X brand name fund, and so they never will criticize them [for fear of repercussions] . . .they probably talk about us behind our backs [laughs].. . .But what they would say is [that] all the people who have [were] hired at these venture firms during the ZIRP era . . . they made a bunch of crappy investments” and now they are being elbowed out — except that it’s too late, observed Lee. “All [the LPs’] money basically just got thrown down the drain because the people in the venture jobs didn’t stick around long enough to see if the companies were successful.” It’s not the fault of these newer investors, Lee continued. “Just a ton of people didn’t get trained and didn’t get any mentorship or apprenticeship were given checkbooks, and a lot of investments were made, and . . .there are a lot of orphaned companies,” as a result. But there’s another reason startups are being left to their own devices “and I find this crazy,” said Lee; in many cases, companies have been orphaned by a more senior general partner “who led the investment – who is still there [at the firm] but just stopped showing up to the board meetings.” For certain companies, it’s been happening for years at this point. No one did as much due diligence during the go-go Covid era of funding, and the corner cutting never quite stopped when it came to these same investments. But it’s also a key reason a growing number of companies are struggling to find outside help with exit strategies, and why LPs would be justified in voicing more frustration. As another longtime VC, Jason Lemkin,told this editorin late 2022 when VCs first stopped showing up at the board meetings of startups that were losing momentum: “[S]houldn’t there be checks and balances? Millions and millions are invested by pension funds and universities and widows and orphans, and when you don’t do any diligence on the way in, and you don’t do continual diligence at a board meeting, you’re kind of abrogating some of your fiduciary responsibilities to your LPs, right?” Check outStrictlyVC Downloadweekly; new episodes come out every Tuesday.

Joby Aviation and Virgin Atlantic partner to launch electric air taxis in the UK,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/15/joby-aviation-and-virgin-atlantic-partner-to-launch-electric-air-taxis-in-the-uk/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Joby Aviationis partnering with Virgin Atlantic to launch electric air taxis in the U.K., marking the seventh country in which the startup hopes to one day commercialize. Joby, whichwent public in 2021via special purpose acquisition merger, did not provide a timeline for when it plans to launch its partnership with Virgin in the U.K. A spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch it would come sometime after Joby launches in the UAE and the U.S. Joby hopes to begin market testing in Dubai late this year or early next after delivering its first eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft to the country. The startup had also planned to launch a commercial service in the U.S., either in New York or Los Angeles, in 2025, but that timeline may get pushed out as Joby works to get the necessary certifications from the Federal Aviation Administration. In October 2024,Joby saidit was close to receiving type certification — which signifies the approval of the vehicle’s design —  but a spokesperson today couldn’t provide an updated timeline. Joby will need to get its own certifications from the U.K. before it launches there, as well. The company applied to have its aircraft validated for use by the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority in July 2022. Joby’s tie-up with Virgin comes nearly seven months after TechCrunch first reported that the two companies had plans to work together — news we came by via one of our“little birds.” Per the deal, Joby will be Virgin’s exclusive airline distribution partner in the U.K. The California-based company also has a mutuallyexclusive dealwith one other airline, Delta, in the U.S. and U.K., but the Virgin partnership falls under that existing deal because Delta owns roughly half of Virgin. Joby’s deal with Delta promises to allow customers to access a premium service that shuttles them from local vertiports directly to the airport. (Vertiports are infrastructure where eVTOLs takeoff, land, and charge.) The Virgin partnership promises a similar network of landing sites across the U.K., but it will start by connecting passengers from the airline’s hubs at London’s Heathrow and Manchester Airport. According to the companies, Virgin customers will be able to reserve a seat on Joby’s aircraft in the future through the Virgin Atlantic app and website. Partnering with airlines is one of the main ways eVTOL companies are planning to go-to-market. Joby’s main rival, Archer Aviation, has made similar deals withUnitedandSouthwest. Many of those deals have included investment from the airlines. Delta, for example, has invested$60 millioninto Joby already, with the option to invest up to $200 million more if Joby delivers on its promises. An investment is not part of Joby’s deal with Virgin, according to a Joby spokesperson. In a statement, Virgin said it would support Joby’s go-to-market efforts in the U.K. by marketing the service to customers, working with regulators, and helping to “build support for the development of landing infrastructure at key airports.” Joby’s eVTOL is designed to carry a pilot, four passengers, and some luggage. It promises to fly at speeds of up to 200 miles per hour, making a flight from Leeds to Manchester a 15-minute journey. The startup is a long way from large scale deployments, but Joby has stated its intentions to launch an air taxi service in the U.S., the U.K., the UAE, South Korea, Japan, India, and Australia.

Nvidia GTC 2025: What to expect from this year’s show,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/15/nvidia-gtc-2025-what-to-expect-from-this-years-show/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us GTC, Nvidia’s biggest conference of the year, begins Monday and runs till Friday in San Jose. TechCrunch will be on the ground covering the news as it happens — and we’re expecting a healthy dose of announcements. CEO Jensen Huang will give a keynote address at the SAP Center on Tuesday at 10 a.m. Pacific, focusing on — what else? — AI and accelerating computing technologies,according to Nvidia. The company is also teasing reveals related to robotics,sovereign AI,AI agents, and automotive — plus 1,000 sessions with 2,000 speakers and close to 400 exhibitors. Here’s how to watch the Nvidia GTC 2025 keynote online, along with many other sessions, talks, and panels. So what do we expect to see at GTC? Well, Nvidia typically reserves a big chunk of the conference for GPU-related debuts. A new, upgraded iteration of the company’s Blackwell chip lineup seems likely. During Nvidia’s most recent earnings call, Huangconfirmedthat the upcoming Blackwell B300 series, codenamed Blackwell Ultra, is slated for release in the second half of this year. In addition to higher computing performance, Blackwell Ultra cards pack more memory (288GB), an attractive feature for customers looking to run and train memory-hungry AI models. Rubin, Nvidia’s next-gen GPU series, is almost certain to get a mention at GTC alongside Blackwell Ultra. Due out in 2026, Rubin promises to deliver what Huang has described as a “big, big, huge step up” in computing power. Huang said during the aforementioned Nvidia earnings call that he’d talk about post-Rubin products at GTC, as well. That could be Rubin Ultra GPUs, or perhaps the GPU architecture that’ll come after the Rubin family. (The chips arenamed after Vera Rubin, the astronomer who discovered dark matter.) Beyond GPUs, Nvidia may illuminate its approach to recent quantum computing advancements. The company has scheduled a “quantum day” for GTC, during which it’ll host execs from prominent companies in the space to “[map] the path toward useful quantum applications.” One thing’s for sure: Nvidia could use a win. Early Blackwell cardsreportedly suffered from severe overheating issues, causing customers to cut their orders. U.S. export controls and fears of tariffs have massively depressed Nvidia’s stock price in recent months. At the same time, the success of Chinese AI lab DeepSeek, which developed efficient models competitive with models from leading AI labs, has prompted investors to worry about the demand for powerful GPUs like Blackwell. Huang has asserted that DeepSeek’s rise to prominence will in fact be anet positivefor Nvidia because it’ll accelerate the broader adoption of AI technology. He has also pointed to the growth of power-hungry so-called “reasoning” models like OpenAI’s o1 as Nvidia’s next mountain to climb. To be clear, Nvidia isn’t exactly hurting. The company reported a record-breaking quarter in February, notching $39.3 billion in revenue and projecting $43 billion in revenue for the subsequent quarter. While rivals such as AMD have begun to encroach on the company’s territory, Nvidiastill commandsan estimated 82% of the GPU market. But Huang isreportedly feeling impatientto see AI applications that matter beyond the tech industry.

Republican Congressman Jim Jordan asks Big Tech if Biden tried to censor AI,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/republican-congressman-jim-jordan-asks-big-tech-if-biden-tried-to-censor-ai/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us On Thursday, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH)sent letters to 16 American technology firms, including Google and OpenAI, asking for past communications with the Biden administration that might suggest the former president “coerced or colluded” with companies to “censor lawful speech” in AI products. The Trump administration’s top technology advisors previously signaled they would pick a fight withBig Tech over “AI censorship,” which is seemingly the next phase in the culture war between conservatives and Silicon Valley. Jordan previously led an investigation into whether the Biden administration and Big Techcolluded to silence conservative voices onsocial media platforms. Now, he’s turning his attention to AI companies — and their intermediaries. In letters to technology executives including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, Jordan pointed to areporthis committee published in December that he claims “uncovered the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to control AI to suppress speech.” In this latest inquiry, Jordan asked Adobe, Alphabet, Amazon, Anthropic, Apple, Cohere, IBM, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI, Palantir, Salesforce, Scale AI, and Stability AI for information. They have until March 27 to provide it. TechCrunch reached out to the companies for comment. Most didn’t immediately respond. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Stability AI declined to comment. There’s one notable omission in Jordan’s list: billionaire Elon Musk’s frontier AI lab, xAI. That may be because Musk, a close Trump ally, is a tech leader who has beenat the forefront of conversations about AI censorship. The writing was on the wall that conservative lawmakers would ramp up scrutiny over alleged AI censorship. Perhaps in anticipation of an investigation such as Jordan’s, several tech companies have changed the ways their AI chatbots handle politically sensitive queries. Earlier this year,OpenAI announced it was changing the way it trains AI modelsto represent more perspectives and ensure ChatGPT wasn’t censoring certain viewpoints. OpenAI denies this was an attempt to appease the Trump administration, but rather an effort to double down on the company’s core values. Anthropic, for its part, has said that its newest AI model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, will refuse to answer fewer questions andgive more nuanced responses on controversial subjects. Other companies have been slower to change how their AI models treat political subject matter. Leading up to the 2024 U.S. election, Google said that its Gemini chatbot wouldn’t respond to political queries. Even well after the election, TechCrunch found thatthe chatbot wouldn’t consistently answer even simple questions related to politics, like “Who is the current President?” Some tech execs, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have added fuel to conservative accusations of Silicon Valley censorship by claiming the Biden administration pressured social media companies tosuppress certain content like COVID-19 misinformation.

Tern AI’s low-cost GPS alternative actually works,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/tern-ais-low-cost-gps-alternative-actually-works/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us We’ve all experienced that moment of frustration when the GPS glitches and you miss an exit on the highway. The team atTern AI, which is building a low-cost GPS alternative, says that’s because the current technology is limited by its reliance on satellite positioning. Tern AI says it has figured out how to locate the position of a vehicle using only map information and a vehicle’s existing sensor data. The company’s pitch: It’s a cheap system that doesn’t require any additional expensive sensors. At SXSW, the Austin-based startup demonstrated exclusively for TechCrunch that it could “derive a position from nothing.” “No triangulation, no satellites, no Wi-Fi, nothing. We just figure out where we are as we drive,” Brett Harrison, co-founder and president, told TechCrunch while Cyrus Behroozi, senior software developer at Tern, loaded up the demo on his iPhone. “That’s really game changing because as we move away from triangulation-based, which limits technology, now we have the ability to be fully off that grid.” Harrison says this breakthrough is important for a number of reasons. From a commercial standpoint, companies that rely on GPS — including ride-hail apps to delivery companies — lose time, money, and gas every time their drivers have to double back because of faulty GPS positioning. More importantly, our most critical systems — from aviation to disaster response to precision farming — rely on GPS. Foreign adversaries have already demonstrated that they canspoof GPS signals, which could have catastrophic impacts both on the economy and national security. The U.S. has signaled that it wants to prioritize alternatives to GPS. During his first term, President Donald Trump signed anexecutive orderto reduce reliance on a single source of PNT (positioning, navigation, and timing) services, like GPS.There are alsoseveral other initiativeswhich direct agencies and bodies like the Department of Defense and the National Security Council to ensure resilient PNT by testing and integrating non-GPS technologies. “DeepSeek came outand said it costus $6 million to do what it took [OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies] billions to do,” Harrison said. “To get that dot to move across a map in real time in a vehicle, it took the government billions of dollars and a few decades. We did it with less than $2 million.” Tern came out of stealth in February 2024 and announced its$4.4 million seed rounda few months later. That’s a quick turnaround to achieve the type of positioning I experienced this week at SXSW. To start the demonstration, Behroozi connected his 2019 Honda Civic to his phone via Bluetooth, allowing the Tern application to pull in data from the vehicle’s existing sensors. He noted that Tern’s tech can be integrated directly into vehicles, beginning model years 2009 and up. Usually, Tern sets the position manually to speed things up, but for our demo, the team wanted a “cold start.” Behroozi turned off his phone’s location services, so the Tern intelligent system had only a cached map of a 500-square-mile boundary around Austin and vehicle sensors to work with. As the car drove, the system picked up road data to work toward “convergence.” It took roughly 10 minutes for the system to reach full convergence from a cold start because, according to Behroozi, there was traffic so our movements were limited. Harrison assured me convergence usually takes around one to two minutes without a start point, and is immediate with one. Harrison noted that Tern’s system can also localize vehicles in parking garages, tunnels, and on mountains, which GPS struggles to do. Harrison wouldn’t explain exactly how, saying the information is “proprietary.” We drove around for a few more minutes after the system reached full convergence, and I watched as it steadily tracked our precise movements in a way that appeared as good as, and in some cases better than, GPS. That became more apparent when we drove into downtown Austin, where my Google Maps regularly mislocated me throughout the week as I navigated urban streets dotted with towering buildings. Harrison said that Tern’s system is also safer from a privacy perspective because with GPS, “if anyone knows your ID, they can find you at any time.” “Our system is a total closed loop,” he said. “Right now, we’re not emitting anything. It’s independently deriving its own position [via on edge computing], so there are no external touchpoints.” “We set up the company and the solution from the start to be scalable. If you look at that Waymo car and all of the hardware that’s embedded, we don’t see that going on a Nissan Sentra anytime soon. It’s just too expensive, ” Harrison said, pointing ahead of us to aWaymo-Uber robotaxi. “At the manufacturer level, if [Tern] is implemented within the infotainment system, it’s just a softwaredownload, so extraordinarily scalable. All new vehicles have the sensor data we need. The map data already exists with all the providers today. So it’s quite simple.” Tern’s potential future customers could be anyone from automakers to mobile phone manufacturers, from Google to Uber. Harrison said the startup is open to growing the company, but also an acquisition. “The primary thing is getting this out into the economy’s hands, with the growing threats and the emergence of tech that’s not realizing its full potential because of the limits of triangulation,” Harrison said. He noted that Tern is exploring possibilities with the government. The startup recently received a contract award from the U.S. Department of Transportation after a week of demonstrating its technology along with nine other companies from around the world. “We’re hoping we did a good job of showing the government what’s possible now with American innovation,” Harrison said. Clarification: This article was updated to clarify how long Tern claims its system usually takes to reach full convergence.

Bluesky quickly sold out of the T-shirt its CEO wore to troll Mark Zuckerberg,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/bluesky-quickly-sold-out-of-the-t-shirt-its-ceo-wore-to-troll-mark-zuckerberg/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us When Bluesky CEO Jay Grabertook the SXSW stagethis week, she managed to make fun of Mark Zuckerberg without mentioning Meta at all. Her black T-shirt was emblazoned with black text stretching across the chest and sleeves, similar to the style ofa T-shirt that the billionaire founder woreat an event last year. Graber’s shirt declared in Latin,Mundus sine Caesaribus. Or, “a world without Caesars.” On Bluesky, users expressed such excitement over Graber’s T-shirt that the platform decided tosell replicasto raise money for its developer ecosystem. The $40 shirt, available in sizes S – XL, sold out in roughly30 minutes. Zuckerberg has drawn comparisons between himself and the Roman dictator Julius Caesar — the particular shirt of his that Graber is referencing saidAut Zuck aut nihil, or “Zuck or nothing.” It’s a nod to the Latin phraseAut Caesar aut nihil, befitting of the Roman leader’s regime. (Yes, it is weird that Zuck goes out of his way to compare himself to a violent dictator.) Though it’s tiny compared to Meta’s empire, Bluesky’s decentralized, open source infrastructure imagines a form of social media where individual executives don’t hold all the power. It creates the opportunity for any developer to contribute to the platform’s growth. So, Graber’s shirt isn’t just a petty swipe at a much larger competitor — it represents the ethos that Bluesky is trying to live up to. “If a billionaire came in and bought Bluesky, or took it over, or if I decided tomorrow to change things in a way that people really didn’t like, then they could fork off and go on to another application,” Graber said at SXSW. “There’s already applications in the network that give you another way to view the network, or you could build a new one as well. And so that openness guarantees that there’s always the ability to move to a new alternative.” Topics Reporter Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

"FBI, EPA, and Treasury told Citibank to freeze funds as Trump administration tries to claw back climate money",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/fbi-epa-and-treasury-told-citibank-to-freeze-funds-as-trump-administration-tries-to-claw-back-climate-money/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Citibank revealed in court filings on Wednesday that the FBI, the EPA, the EPA inspector general, and the Treasury Department have all requested that the bank freeze accounts of several nonprofits and state government agencies. The accounts were frozen in February, but thenew documentsmake public details that had previously been unknown, including a full list of the nonprofits under FBI scrutiny. The funds were disbursed as part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act, a lawpassed by Congress in 2022. Of that, the EPA received$14 billion for a National Clean Investment Fund, which provides grants to green banks. Green banks use those funds to provide financing for clean technology projects around the country. Startups that have technologies that are ready to scale commercially were eligible to receive financing to make projects a reality. The funding was mostly to be used for loans, which were to be paid back and recycled for future lending. Green banks tend to have delinquency rates on par with commercial and residential portfolios held by other commercial lenders. Citibank was selected as the financial agent to administer that money, holding it in accounts under the names of the awardees. It is also administering a separate, $6 billion Clean Communities Investment Accelerator program. The EPA’s contract with Citibank was publicly announced in April 2024. The FBI has requested that Citibank place 30-day administrative freezes on accounts held by nonprofits that were recipients of the green bank funding. It also asked the bank to freeze other nonprofit and state government agency accounts, including Habitat for Humanity, United Way, the Colorado Clean Energy Fund, and New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. Three nonprofits that received green bank funds have sued Citibank, asking the bank to release the money in their accounts. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has said that the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund doesn’t align with the agency’s priorities and that he has concerns about fraud, though he has not provided evidence to support that claim. In a hearing on Wednesday, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia questioned a Justice Department attorney representing the EPA. “Can you proffer any evidence that [the grant] was illegal, or evidence of abuse or fraud or bribery — that any of that was improperly or unlawfully done, other than the fact that Mr. Zeldin doesn’t like it?” Judge Tanya Chutkansaid. Judge Chutkan also ordered the Justice Department to provide the court with details about the alleged fraud, “because I don’t have the credible evidence that’s required.” Update 3/13/25: Added details from the Wednesday hearing.

But some Bench customers say they’re being charged to get books or tax returns they previously paid for. A lawsuitfiled on Tuesday by Bench customer Qorum claims that Bench required it to pay to get its 2023 tax return, despite having already paid for the service under Bench’s previous owners. “Defendant Jesse Tinsley made negligent misrepresentations when he falsely stated that Employer.com would honor prepaid Bench services,” the lawsuit alleges. Another customer, who requested anonymity, was shocked to learn they needed to renew their subscription to get accounting books completed when they paid for that service two years ago, according to correspondence seen by TechCrunch. When they questioned this, a Bench representative told them that “Bench 2.0” has no affiliation with prior obligations and that Employer.com couldn’t take on unpaid work. Employer.com’s CMO Matt Charney strongly disputes that Bench is charging for previously paid work. “We have been, and are honoring pre-paid services for our customers,” he said. Charney also said it delivered that tax 2023 return to Qorum without requiring additional payment. But Qorum’s founder Andrew Pietra told TechCrunch he was required to continue his subscription to get the return in the first place. Under its previous ownership, Bench burnedthrough $135 millionandstruggled to get AIto replace human bookkeepers. That led to long delays and big piles of books that still needed to be completed, according to former employees. Multiple Bench customerspreviously told TechCrunch thatEmployer.com had also sent them notices intended to get them to click on a consent button that had them foregoing refunds on prepaid services. Many books and returns remained incomplete when Bench abruptly shut down on December 26 last year. Employer.com, a U.S. company,announced plansto buy the Canadian fintech less than 72 hours later. Employer.com bought Bench for $9 million,bankruptcy filingssubmitted in Canada show. The fintech’s abrupt collapse was caused by a lack of liquidity after its main creditor, the National Bank of Canada, declined to lend it an additional $7.7 million in December 2024. The NBC had already provided $51 million USD in credit to the troubled startup,according to previous filings. Ironically, it’s the news of Bench’s sudden shutdown that led to its rescue.

Want it in your inbox every Friday?Sign up here. This week showed more optimism among startups than in other corners of the world, with entrepreneurs feeling confident enough to acquire other companies, raise fresh funding, and even say no to more money. Not quite four weddings and a funeral, but almost. Hinged: Hinge Health, a virtual physical therapy startup that uses technology to help treat chronic musculoskeletal conditions,filed to go publicand is hoping to raise up to $500 million through this offering. Fervor: Fervo Energy, a well-funded startup that is working with Google on a first-of-its-kind geothermal power plant, is reportedlyplanning to IPOin the next two years. Picked: Peak.ai, a startup founded in Manchester, England, that builds “decision-making” AI,was acquired by UiPath, the now public robotic process automation (RPA) company. Peak had raised $121 million, including a $75 million round backed by SoftBank in 2021. Butterfly effect: Manus, the “agentic” AI platform launched by Chinese startup Butterfly Effect, isgenerating a ton of buzz, although some early users warned it is no panacea, writes TechCrunch’s newly appointed AI editor Kyle Wiggers. But the butterfly effect is still there: Browser Use, one of the tools powering Manus,is also going viral. The end: Swedish battery manufacturing startup Northvoltfiled for bankruptcyin Sweden this week. It had already filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. in November. Plenty of deals, but also another week in which the round’s size won’t tell you the round’s letter. Ditto: San Francisco-based startup Dittoraised an $82 million Series Bat a $462 million post-money valuation to make sure corporate clients can access data on edge devices even when connectivity is unstable. Good karma: Nirvana, an AI-based insurance platform that uses telematics data to build and manage insurance policies for truckers,raised an $80 million Series C round of fundingat an $830 million post-money valuation. BI: Omni, a business intelligence platform that helps organizations better analyze their data, closed a$69 million Series B round. The company also expects its annual recurring revenue to triple this year, increasing from nearly $10 million. Pentesting: Pentera, a cybersecurity startup founded in Tel Aviv but now based in Boston, raiseda $60 million Series Dat a valuation over $1 billion. It plans to use the funding for M&A and product development. Problem zolved: Zolve, a neobank for highly skilled foreigners moving to the U.S. without credit history,raised $51 million in equityfor its Series B round. It also secured $200 million in debt and plans to enter new geographies. New name, new money: Estonia-based startup Blackwall, formerly known as BotGuard, raised a€45 million Series B round(approximately $49.2 million) to protect SMBs from malicious online traffic via midmarket hosting platforms and other service providers. Predictive maintenance: Indian startup Infinite Uptime, which helps factories optimize equipment usage thanks to a sensor-based predictive maintenance solution,raised a $35 million Series C funding roundto expand into the U.S. and other markets. Italians do it better?Early-stage Italian VC firm Vento islaunching a €75 million fundto back Italian startup founders, including those living abroad. This is Vento’s second fund; its portfolio already includes some 100 startups. Y Combinator’s latest Demo Day signaled a “vibe shift,” according to a regular attendee. Terrence Rohan, an investor with Otherwise Fund who’s been investing in Y Combinator since 2010, noted that it is now common to see founders raising less money on purpose — and not for lack of VC interest. This stirred discussion as towhether it is a good idea.

The biggest breach of US government data is under way,https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/doge-biggest-breach-of-united-states-government-data-under-way/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Operatives working for Elon Musk have gained unprecedented access to a swath of U.S. government departments — including agencies responsible for managing data on millions of federal employees and a system that handles $6 trillion in payments to Americans. During the first three weeks of Trump’s second administration, Musk’s group of representatives — a presidential advisory board known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE — hastaken control of top federal departments and datasets, despite questions about their security clearances, their cybersecurity practices, and the legality of Musk’s activities. Whether a feat or a coup (which depends entirely on your point of view), a small group ofmostly young, private-sector employeesfrom Musk’s businesses and associates — many with no prior government experience — can now view and, in some cases, control the federal government’s most sensitive data held on millions of Americans and the nation’s closest allies. The access by Musk’s DOGE team represents the widest-known compromise of federal government-held data by a private group of individuals — and little has gotten in their way. DOGE has acknowledged few details about its ongoing activities. That task has been left to the media, which has reported questionable cybersecurity practices and the breakdown in long-standing cybersecurity norms that risk sensitive government data from being accessed by nefarious actors. Much of DOGE’s work is avoiding oversight and transparency, leaving open questions around whether cybersecurity and privacy practices are being followed. It’s unclear whether DOGE staffers are following the procedures to keep this data from being accessed by other people, or if any other steps are being taken to protect the sensitive data on Americans. So far, the evidence suggests that security is not top of mind. For example, a DOGE staffer reportedlyused a personal Gmail account to access a government call, and a newly filedlawsuit by federal whistleblowersclaims DOGE ordered an unauthorized email server to be connected to the government network, which violates federal privacy law. DOGE staffers are also said to be feeding sensitive data from at least one government departmentinto AI software. Whether DOGE staffers are bad actors misses part of the point. Acts of subterfuge, espionage, or ignorance could produce the same suboptimal outcome: exposure or loss of the nation’s sensitive datasets. For now, it’s worth looking at how we got here. The ease in which DOGE took over the departments and their vast stores of Americans’ data took career officials and U.S. lawmakers by surprise, who continue to seek answers from the Trump administration. Musk’s efforts to take control of the nation’s data stores also privately alarmed cybersecurity professionals, some of whom have spent their careers in government dedicated to securing Americans’ most sensitive systems and data. Questions remain about what level of security clearance the DOGE staff have and whether their interim security clearance gives them the authority to demand access to restricted federal systems. On returning to office, Trumpsigned an executive orderallowing administration officials to grant “top secret” and compartmentalized security clearance to individuals on an interim basis with little to no substantial vetting, a sharp departure from long-established protocols. The confusion over DOGE staff clearances has led to brief standoffs between several career officials at federal departments in recent days. At the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), senior officials were put on leave after standing in the way of DOGE staff to protect classified information,according to the Associated Press. DOGE subsequently gained access to the classified facility at USAID, which reportedly contained intelligence reports. Katie Miller, an adviser for DOGE, said ina post on Xthat no classified material was accessed by DOGE “without proper security clearances,” though details of the team’s clearanceremains unspecified, including how many people were granted the interim secret clearances. Severalsenior lawmakers of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligencesaid Wednesday that they were still seeking answers about DOGE and what clearance its members have. “No information has been provided to Congress or the public as to who has been formally hired under DOGE, under what authority or regulations DOGE is operating, or how DOGE is vetting and monitoring its staff and representatives before providing them seemingly unfettered access to classified materials and Americans’ personal information,” the senators wrote. Within a week of President Trump’s inauguration — andhis executive order establishing DOGE— Musk’s staffers began infiltrating a variety of federal agencies. The U.S. Treasury’s sensitive payments systems, which contain personal information of millions of Americans who receive payments from the government, from tax refunds to Social Security checks, was among the first. DOGE has alsogained accessto the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources department that includes databases on the personal information of all federal workers, and USAJOBS, whichhas dataon applicants who applied for a federal job. Officials at the OPM said they had no visibility or oversight into Musk’s team’s access to its systems. “It creates real cybersecurity and hacking implications,” they told Reuters. DOGE’s activity has led to widespread opposition, including from some Republicans. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), who serves as the most senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee,called Musk’s access to sensitive federal payments systems a national security risk, given the conflict of interest over his extensive business operations in China. A group of senior Democrats later saidin a letter to the Treasurythat DOGE’s access to sensitive government data “could irreparably damage national security.” In a post on Bluesky, former Republican strategist Stuart Stevenscalled the takeoverof the Treasury’s systems “the most significant data leak in cyber history,” adding: “Private individuals in the data business now have access to your Social Security information.” The Treasurydefended its move to grant access to the department’s sensitive payments systems, confirming in an unattributed response to Democratic lawmakers that Musk’s DOGE team has access to the Treasury’s banks of personal information on Americans. Tom Krause, the chief executive ofCloud Software Group, which owns Citrix and several other technology companies, is now a senior Treasury employeeserving as assistant secretaryand has control over trillions of dollars in public funds. DOGE has since gained access to multiple sensitive internal systems at the Department of Education, including datasetscontaining the personal information on millions of students enrolled in financial aid. The Washington Post reports that DOGE staffersfed sensitive employee and financial datafrom the department into an AI system to probe the agency’s spending. DOGE staff alsodemanded “access to all” systems at the Small Business Administration, including contracts, payments, and human resources information. Musk’s teamalso reportedly has accessto payment systems within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, andaccess to dataat the U.S. agency that administers Medicare and Medicaid. DOGE is alsoaccessing personnel systemsat the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) andplans to access aviation systemsat the Federal Aviation Administration after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffygranted DOGE access. Musk said ina post on Xthat DOGE plans to “make rapid safety upgrades to the air traffic control system,” without providing specifics. Later, DOGEgained accessto the Department of Energy’s IT systems, despite reported concerns by officials at the lack of a standard background check on a DOGE staffer. Musk’s staffers also reportedly haveread-only access to datawithin the federal consumer watchdog, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. There are untold security risks that come from granting access to the inner data core of the U.S. government to a group of unelected and private individuals with spurious vetting. To name just a couple of things that could go wrong: Accessing the government network from a non-approved computer harboring malware can compromise other devices on the federal network and allow the theft of sensitive government information, regardless of whether it is classified. And the mishandling of personal information on devices or cloud environments that have not met the standards of the government’s top security specifications, or use the strongest security controls, puts that data at risk of further compromise or leak. These are not unlikely scenarios; these kinds of breaches happen all the time. Last year alone sawsome of the biggest data breaches in historycaused bymalicious access gained through the personal devices of company employees, who accidentally installed malware by downloading knock-off software onto their personal computers and not using proper security protections like multi-factor authentication. Any compromise of the team’s credentials or access, or any improper handling of sensitive databases could result in the irretrievable loss, theft, or misplacement of sensitive government data. Perhaps most troubling is DOGE, and its activities, are operating outside of public scrutiny. Officials and lawmakers tasked with government oversight reportedly have no insight into what data DOGE has access to within the government or what its cybersecurity controls or protections are — if any at all. The departmental professionals who have spent much of their careers protecting access to the data stored in these systems cannot do much but stand by and watch as private individuals with little to no prior government experience raid their most sensitive datasets. Technology and privacy lawyer Cathy Gellis,writing in Techdirt, argues Musk and his DOGE team are likely “personally liable” under the U.S. federal hacking law, known as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which covers the accessing of federal systems without the proper authorization. A court would still ultimately have to determine DOGE’s activity as “unauthorized access” and therefore illegal, wrote Gellis. There is also the question of how U.S. state governments will respond to the compromise of their residents’ data at the federal level. U.S. states have data breach laws requiring the protection of their citizens’ data, even if the federal government does not. A coalition of more than a dozen Democratic state attorneys general said they willfile a lawsuit to block DOGE accessing sensitive federal government payment systemscontaining personal data on Americans, without providing a timeline. The access also puts relationships with the United States and its diplomatic allies on shaky ground. Allied nationsmay not want to share intelligence with the U.S. governmentif they think the information could leak, spill into the public domain, or otherwise get lost as a result of the breakdown in cybersecurity practices aimed at protecting sensitive information. In reality, the cybersecurity consequences of DOGE’s ongoing access to federal departments and datasets may not be known for some time.

Klein went public in 2006 with documents revealing that the NSA was using a secret room in an AT&T hub in San Francisco to tap into the backbone of the internet. Behind the door of the now-infamousRoom 641A, optical splitting wiretaps were creating an identical copy of raw internet traffic and funneling it back to the NSA. Klein’s disclosure was confirmation that the U.S. government was accessing the internet data on millions of Americans using powers granted by Congress in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In 2013, then-NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked thousands of classified documents to journalists detailing widescale NSA surveillance around the world. Klein’s death wasconfirmed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the San Francisco-based digital rights group who Klein turned to, and which went on to sue the federal government following Klein’s disclosures.

US lawmakers urge UK spy court to hold Apple ‘backdoor’ secret hearing in public,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/us-lawmakers-urge-uk-spy-court-to-hold-apple-backdoor-secret-hearing-in-public/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A group of bipartisan U.S. lawmakers are urging the head of the U.K.’s surveillance court to hold an open hearing into Apple’s anticipated challenge of an alleged secret U.K. government legal demand. U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, along with four other federal lawmakers, saidin a letter this weekto the president of the U.K.’s Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) that it is “in the public interest” that any hearings about the alleged order are not held in secret. The lawmakers’ letter also says that the alleged U.K. order has barred California-based Apple from engaging in speech that is “constitutionally protected” under U.S. law and impedes the lawmakers’ ability to conduct congressional oversight. The Washington Postrevealed in February that the U.K. government had earlier this year secretly ordered Apple to create a“backdoor,”allowing U.K. authorities to access the cloud-stored data of any Apple customer worldwide. Apple, which is legally barred from disclosing or commenting on the “technical capabilities notice,” reportedly refused andpulled its Advanced Data Protection iCloud data-encryption featurefrom U.K. customers, rather than comply with the backdoor order. TheU.K.’s Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which hears legal cases related to the use of U.K. surveillance powers, is scheduled to hear a private petition on Friday, perthe tribunal’s public schedule. The hearing reportedly relates to Apple, according to Wyden’s letter. Apple did not comment when contacted by TechCrunch on Friday. The U.K. government has so far declined to comment on operational matters, which includes “confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,” per a spokesperson. It’s not clear how many companies have received a technical demand from the U.K. government.

UK’s secret iCloud backdoor order triggers civil rights challenge,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/uks-secret-icloud-backdoor-order-triggers-civil-rights-challenge/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Posted: The U.K. government’s secret order to Apple demanding it backdoor the end-to-end encrypted version of its iCloud storage service has now been challenged by two civil rights groups, Liberty and Privacy International, which filed complaints Thursday. They called the order “unacceptable and disproportionate” and warned of “global consequences” as the access order is thought to extend to non-U.K. users too. The pair, along with two named individuals — Privacy International’s executive director Gus Hosein and the civil liberties advocate Ben Wizner — have instructed law firm Leigh Day to challenge Home Department Secretary of State Yvette Cooper’s decision to serve Apple with a technical capability notice (TCN) under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA). The existence of the secret order only emerged viapress reports last month. “Privacy International and Liberty fear this TCN, or similar TCNs in the future, could be used to undermine end-to-end encryption essential to the protection of privacy and free expression,” they wrote in a press release. Apple has already fileda legal challengeto the TCN — and its appeal is due to be heard by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), the body that oversees complaints against U.K. intelligence agencies. Both civil rights groups, Hosein, and Wizner contend that they are direct victims of the government’s TCN decision and are asked for their complaints to be joined to Apple’s. They are also calling for the case to be heard in public, rather than behind closed doors — joiningearlier calls from privacy rights groups. The IPT hearing is thought to be scheduled for Friday, March 14. Topics Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

Y Combinator’s police surveillance darling Flock Safety raises $275M at $7.5B valuation,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/y-combinators-police-surveillance-darling-flock-safety-raises-275m-at-7-5b-valuation/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Flock Safetyand one of its long-time VCs, Bedrock Capital,announcedThursday that the startup raised a fresh $275 million at a $7.5 billion valuation. Flock makes computer vision-enabled video surveillance technology used by law enforcement as well as businesses, property management companies, and so on. It’s best known for itsautomatic license plate recognition tech, but Flock also makes gunshot detection tech marketed to schools, and recentlyacquired public safety drone company Aerodome. Flock was founded in 2017 and went through Y Combinator that same year. Growth exploded in the subsequent years. Flock crossed over $300 million in annual recurring revenue last year, which is 70% year-over-year growth, Flock spokesperson Holly Beilin told TechCrunch. The Atlanta-based startup has now raised over $950 million in total funding,according to PitchBook data, and its last valuation a year ago was $4.8 billion. Return investors Andreessen Horowitz, Greenoaks, Meritech Capital, Matrix Partners, and Y Combinator participated in this round. Given that it makes surveillance tech, Flock has unsurprisingly had its share of controversies. For instance, theACLU cited concerns with Flockover the kind of mass surveillance it enables and, a year ago, urged the company to allow independent review of its products. Privacy advocates in Norfolk, Virginiaare currently suingto stop Flock from being deployed there. Flock is also facing a wrongful termination lawsuit from a sitting mayor of a small California town,as TechCrunch recently reported. That said, Flock has been a VC darling for years. For instance, Bedrock’s founder, Geoff Lewis, recounted how he flew to Atlanta in 2018 to beg Flock co-founder Garrett Langley (pictured above) to take a $10 million Series A-1, one of the first checks from Lewis’ new firm. But Langley had just closed Flock’s Series A. That deal was a “totally insane” $60 million valuation, asBedrock described it— about triple the valuation of the A round just a few months earlier. Langley took the money — and has gone on to take more than $164 million in investments from Bedrock since. By the way, Lewis, who hailed from Founders Fund, now has other big names in Bedrock’s portfolio, like OpenAI, Rippling, andMach Industries. Meanwhile, a16z’s American Dynamism fund lead, David Ulevitch, led other rounds for Flock. “Beyond protecting property, Flock Safety is literally helping to save lives,” Ulevitch and a16z growth VC David Georgeopinedin 2021. YC’s Garry Tan took to LinkedIn justa few months agoto applaud the success rate Flock claims it has achieved in fighting crime.But it’s Flock’s revenue growth, in addition to its public safety products, that’s caused investors to “continue to double and triple down on Flock,” Beilin said.

Y Combinator urges the White House to support Europe’s Digital Markets Act,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/y-combinator-urges-the-white-house-to-support-europes-digital-markets-act/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Y Combinator, one of the world’s most prolific startup accelerators, sent a letter on Wednesday urging the Trump administration to openly support Europe’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), a wide-ranging piece of legislation thataims to crack open Big Tech’s market power. The DMA designates six tech companies as “gatekeepers” to the internet — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, and Microsoft — and limits these technology kingpins from engaging in anticompetitive tactics on their platforms, in favor of interoperability. The law became applicable in May 2023, and it’salready had a major impact on American tech companies. In a letter to the White Houseposted on Xby YC’s head of Public Policy, Luther Lowe, the startup accelerator argued that the DMA shouldn’t be lumped in with other European tech legislation, which U.S. officials often criticize as being overbearing. Instead, YC argues in the letter that the spirit of Europe’s DMA is in line with values that promote — not hinder — American innovation. “[W]e respectfully urge the White House to recalibrate its stance toward Europe’s digital regulation, drawing a clear line between measures that hamper innovation and those that foster it,” states YC’s letter, which was also signed by YC-backed startups, independent tech companies, and trade associations. It’s not entirely surprising that YC would come out in explicit public support of the DMA. After all, the accelerator markets itself as a champion of “Little Tech” — an American venture-backed ecosystem of technology startups. YC argues in the letter that the DMA opens up key avenues to create opportunities for American startups in AI, search, and consumer apps, and prevents Big Tech companies from boxing out smaller ventures. Specifically, YC in its letter points to Applereportedly delaying its LLM-powered version of Siri until 2027, years after competitors brought generative AI voice assistants to market. YC argues this represents a lack of competitive pressure, noting that third-party developers of AI voice assistants are unable to integrate their services into Apple’s operating systems YC might take Big Tech to task for its reported anticompetitive behavior and take shots at companies like Apple, which it argues harms the venture-backed startup ecosystem. But YC and other supposedly Little Tech-aligned VCs are actually becoming quite influential in Washington. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), which published a “Little Tech Agenda” last year, spends millions of dollars trying to influence policy battles at the federal and local levels. According to data fromOpen Secrets, a16z’s contributions during the 2024 U.S. election cycle totaled $89 million. YC, still a smaller player in American politics,contributed around $2 million. What’s less clear here is how the Trump administration will respond to the DMA in the long run — and YC’s endorsement of it. President Trump signaled in January that he wouldprotect American tech companies from overzealous European regulators. However, Trump has alsohistorically been tough on Big Tech firmslike Apple, Google, and Meta. During the Paris AI Action Summit in February, Vice President J.D. Vance criticized a few of the EU’s laws against tech companies, including the Digital Services Act and General Data Protection Regulation. However, Vance didn’t mention the DMA, which more narrowly targets anticompetitive tech industry practices. Lowe told TechCrunch last yearduring a StrictlyVC eventthat the DMA is “not perfect, but at least they’re taking a stab at figuring out how do we curb the most egregious forms of self-preferencing by these large firms.” Lowe did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

Could deep tech serve as Europe’s  path to autonomy from the US?,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/could-europes-16b-deeptech-bet-be-a-path-to-autonomy-from-the-us/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Amid geopolitical tensions and volatile markets, the question of Europe’s ability to weather the storms ahead, especially as President Trump seems intent on having his pound of tariffs from the continent, is looming large. But an extensive new report claims deep tech is poised to become a key pillar of Europe’s security, defense, and future autonomy, in particular from the U.S. Deep tech attracted €15 billion ($16.3 billion) in venture investments in 2024, according to a 184-page report by venture firms Lakestar, Walden Catalyst, Dealroom, and the deep tech conference Hello Tomorrow. The report also found that nearly one-third of all venture capital invested in Europe is now going to deep tech. M&A activity in the space increased to $12.2 billion last year, the report said, but it also found that European deep tech startups still rely on the U.S. for exits. Furthermore, 50% of the growth capital raised by deep tech startups comes from outside the continent. Still, deep tech could also be seen as a hedge against normal “momentum investing” among venture capitalists, said the report. The report’s co-author, Lukas Leitner, also a deep tech investor at Lakestar, told TechCrunch that while geopolitical tensions pose significant challenges, Europe needs to embrace the moment, and deep tech could be the key that unlocks future resilience for the continent. However, the road ahead is not without challenges. The U.S. has a “flywheel effect” in deep tech while Europe’s ecosystem is still immature, Leitner noted. “We have a flywheel in the ‘shallow’ tech scene. You see a lot of second-time founders, coming out of Revolut and so on, building great companies. But not yet from deep tech companies.” “Europe has strong research institutions, engineering talent, and supportive public sentiment for deep tech, but there need to be policy changes to foster a culture that supports taking risks,” he added. Arnaud de la Tour, the CEO of Hello Tomorrow, said that the notion that compute-poor Europe would always lag in AI was recently challenged by the appearance of open source DeepSeek: “It’s a huge opportunity for Europe, because we have great AI talent … Many are looking to come back to Europe because of the geopolitical landscape. But we definitely need to have the right policy framework in order to unlock the kind of potential that we have.” Leitner pointed out that Europe’s relative weakness in computing power is offset by its strengths in photonics computing, which offers major advantages in speed and efficiency. “We’re really good in Europe with photonics, because we have good laser systems, and we have good fundamental research on the photonic side,” he said. De la Tour added that Europe could also take advantage of a brain drain in the U.S. as science is defunded by the Trump administration. “The National Science Foundation, which is the biggest supporter of founder-applied research in the U.S. has had its budget cut by half. A lot of those great scientists don’t have a job anymore, and many could come to Europe,” he said. Topics Editor At Large Mike Butcher (M.B.E.) is Editor-at-large of TechCrunch.

"Vento rolls out new €75M fund for Italian founders, no matter where they live",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/vento-hopes-new-e75m-fund-for-italian-founders-anywhere-will-kick-italys-ecosystem-into-life/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Over the last 15 years or so, as European venture capital shifted into a higher gear, one way to help a nation’s ecosystem flourish was to invest in founders from that country, regardless of where they were based. This would help re-patriate the entrepreneurial mindset back home. In Europe, the approach was pioneered in part by Paris-basedKima Ventures. Now a new venture firm hopes to replicate that idea from Italy. Vento, one of Italy’s most active private early-stage VCs, is launching its second fund, hard-capped at €75 million, specifically to back Italian startup founders at home and abroad. The sector-agnostic fund originated from the organizers ofItalian Tech Week(ITW), held annually in Turin, which has hosted the likes of Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, and Elon Musk, among others. The event was originally launched by Fiat family scion John Elkann, chairman of Vento, as well as chairman of Stellantis (the parent company of Fiat) and Exor (the holding company of the Agnelli family, which controls Fiat and other assets). Understandably for someone of his status, Elkann has an extensive network both in Europe and Silicon Valley, which he helps bring to ITW. So it’s perhaps no coincidence that Vento’s Investment Committee includes such tech industry veterans as Diego Piacentini, Mike Volpi (formerly of Index Ventures), and Jean de La Rochebrochard. Ironically, Rochebrochard recently joined the very same Kima Ventures that Vento hopes to emulate, after being controversiallyremovedfrom Newwave, a French venture outfit, last year. To date, Vento has already invested in 100 startups, including Bee, JetHR, and Qomodo. Fund II plans to invest in 375 investments over five years, said the company. Diyala D’Aveni, CEO of Vento, told TechCrunch over a call that “Italy is quite behind compared to other European countries, but we think the trajectory is the same as the others. So that’s why we’re doing this. Italian Tech Week is a way for us to bring people from outside of Italy, on the one side, to push incredible investors to meet Italian founders and see the potential of the Italian ecosystem, and inspire the talent in Italy to build their own companies. We think the fact that there are not many success stories in Italy is kind of preventing the ecosystem to grow.” Added D’Aveni, “There’s no lack of capital. It’s a lack of companies, but we just need some success stories, and then the whole flywheel will kick off, and we will see what we saw in France.” Italian Tech Week feeds usefully into this strategy, allowing Vento to evaluate over 3,500 startups that apply to appear at the event, maintaining a selective 2.5% conversion rate with a standardized €150,000 ticket size, and with some follow-on investments being made. But what was the problem with previous Italian tech founders that Elkann felt this fund would solve? “When we launched Vento’s first fund in 2022, we recognized that Italy’s technological and entrepreneurial potential was significantly underserved,” he told TechCrunch. “Italian founders have always demonstrated exceptional … entrepreneurial spirit, but the ecosystem was not there. Vento was created to address this gap by providing not just capital, but a comprehensive platform that combines direct investment, venture building, and network development through Italian Tech Week.” However, Italian company law is often considered less favorable to startup founders compared to U.K. or U.S. company vehicles. Does he expect the startups that Vento funds to be Italy-domiciled or will it be agnostic? “Our primary commitment is to identify exceptional Italian founders and support them in their global entrepreneurial journey,” he said. “Italy is making significant strides to become increasingly competitive in the international technology landscape, and we are confident that soon these regulatory differences between countries will become less and less relevant.” To be fair, Italy’s tech scene is improving. According toDealroom data, venture capital investment in Italian startups totaled $5.72 billion across the last five years (2020 to 2024), a more than threefold increase from the previous five years, when it hit only $1.7 billion. D’Aveni added that there were already plans to reach out internationally: “We already have a network of founders outside of Italy who are sending us deals, as well as micro-communities of Italians in New York, London, Berlin, and Paris, among others.” Topics Editor At Large Mike Butcher (M.B.E.) is Editor-at-large of TechCrunch.

Googlesaid in a blog postthat it’ll upgrade more users from Google Assistant to Gemini “over the coming months.” Later this year, Assistant will no longer be accessible on most mobile devices or available from app stores. “Additionally, we’ll be upgrading tablets, cars and devices that connect to your phone, such as headphones and watches, to Gemini,” the company added. “We’re also bringing a new experience, powered by Gemini, to home devices like speakers, displays and TVs.” Google said it’ll share more details with users in the next few months, and that, until then, Assistant will continue to operate on the aforementioned devices. Google notes it has worked to improve the Gemini user experience ahead of the Assistant wind-down, especially for users relying on various Assistant functions. For instance, Google has added several highly requested features to Gemini on Android devices, such as the ability to play music, support for timers, and an option to take actions directly from a user’s lock screen. The move to drop Assistant in favor of Gemini isn’t surprising, especially considering Google launched its Pixel 9 smartphone line with Gemini as the default virtual assistant. Google notes that Gemini has more advanced capabilities than Assistant (in theory, at least), and provides new ways of getting help and info on topics via tools likeGemini LiveandDeep Research.

What to know about TikTok’s uncertain future in the US and the people who want to buy it,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/what-to-know-about-tiktoks-uncertain-future-in-the-us-and-the-people-who-want-to-buy-it/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for four years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government. Just this past month, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Storein February. Nonetheless, TikTok’s future remains uncertain, and a number of investors are competing for the opportunity to purchase the app. The platform’s U.S. business could have its valuation soar to upward of$60 billion, as estimated by CFRA Research’s senior vice president, Angelo Zino. To fully understand this high-stakes drama, we’ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok’s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations. The drama first began inAugust 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance. A month later, Trump’s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarilyblockedTrump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded. Things began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. The U.S. House of Representatives,in an overwhelming 360-58 vote, passed the legislation against TikTok.On April 23, 2024,the Senate passed the bill. Shortly after,President Joe Bidensigned the bill requiring TikTok to be sold or banned. In response,TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws. On December 27, 2024, Trumpopposedthe potential ban of TikTok in a court filing, stating he could find a way to keep the app in the U.S. This stance was a stark contrast to his approach during his first presidency and presented a surprising turn of events for TikTok. In January,the U.S. Supreme Courtupheld the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), commonly referred to as “the TikTok ban.” TikTok made a formal announcement that it would likely have to go dark on January 19. Although TikTok indeedshut itself downin the U.S. when the act came into effect, it didn’t last long. The appcame back onlineless than 12 hours later. The platform noted, “As a result of President Trump’s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.” On January 20, Trump signed an executive order that postponed the TikTok ban for 75 days. This extension provides the app with additional time to either sell a stake in the platform or reach an agreement with Trump. His goal is to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company. More recently,in early March, Trump told reporters that his administration was in talks with four different groups that are interested in buying the platform,per Reuters. No definitive deal has been reached yet for the sale of the platform, but we could find out very soon. Below is a list of the investor groups and companies rumored to be potential buyers of TikTok’s U.S. operations. (Surprisingly,Elon Muskis not among them.) The People’s Bid for TikTokis a consortium organized by Project Liberty founderFrank McCourt, who is also the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis are helping to assemble the bid. The main mission of The People’s Bid to acquire TikTok is to prioritize privacy and data control, taking an open source approach. Supporters involved include: Jesse Tinsley, the CEO and founder of Employer.com, is leading a consortium of American investors. Last month, Tinsley announced a$30 billion all-cash offerto acquire TikTok’s U.S. operations. The story has been updated after publication to include new interested parties.

However, a new report has emerged, suggesting that Oracle is the leading candidate to serve as the cloud technology partner for managing TikTok in the U.S., according toThe Information. Sources including investors, bankers, and former executives familiar with TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, told the outlet that the company favors Oracle over other cloud providers. Since 2022, TikTok has beenutilizing Oracle servers to store data of U.S. users, making it a likely option for this deal. The report suggests that ByteDance still wants to have a hands-on role in TikTok’s operations, with Oracle as a partner. Additionally,President Trumphas shown support for Oracle’s role in the deal.

"Move over, Apple: Meet the alternative app stores coming to the EU",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/move-over-apple-meet-the-alternative-app-stores-coming-to-the-eu/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us People in the European Union are now allowed to access alternative app stores thanks to theDigital Markets Act(DMA), a regulation designed tofoster increased competitionin the app ecosystem. Like Apple’s App Store, alternative app marketplaces allow for easy access to a wider world of apps, but instead of the apps going through Apple’s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through anotarization processto ensure they meet some “baseline platform integrity standards,”Apple says— like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple. To run an alternative app marketplace, developers must accept Apple’s alternative business terms for DMA-compliant apps in the EU. This includespaying a new Core Technology Fee of €0.50for each first annual install of their marketplace app, even before the threshold of 1 million installs is met, which is the bar for other EU apps distributed under Apple’s DMA business terms. Despite the complicated new rules, a handful of developers have taken advantage of the opportunity to distribute their apps outside of Apple’s walls. Below is a list of the alternative app stores iPhone users in the EU can try today. Co-created by developer Riley Testut, maker of the Nintendo game emulator appDelta, the AltStore PAL is an officially approved alternative app marketplace in the EU. Theopen sourceapp store will allow independent developers to distribute their apps alongside the apps from AltStore’s makers, Delta, and aclipboard manager, called Clip. Unlike Apple’s App Store, AltStore apps are self-hosted by the developer. To work, developers download an alternative distribution packet (ADP) and upload it to their server, then create a “source” that users will add to the AltStore to access their apps. That means the only apps you’ll see in the AltStore are those you’ve added yourselves. Somepopular apps that users are addinginclude the virtual machine appUTM, which lets you run Windows and other software on iOS or iPad;OldOS, a re-creation of iOS 4 that’s built in SwiftUI;Kotoba, the iOS dictionary available as a stand-alone app; torrenting appiTorrent; qBittorrent remote client for iOS devices calledqBitControl; and social discovery platformPeopleDrop. MacPaw’s Setapp became one of thefirst companies to agree to Apple’s new DMA business termsto set up an alternative app store for EU users. The company has long offered a subscription-based service featuring a selection of curated apps for customers on iOS and Mac. Following the implementation of the DMA, it releasedSetapp Mobile, an alternative app store for iOS users only in the EU. Similar to its other subscription offerings, the new app store includes dozens of apps under a single recurring subscription price, and the number of apps grows over time. The apps are free from in-app purchases or ads and are generally considered high quality; however, it doesn’t include big-name apps like Facebook, Uber, Netflix and others. Setapp Mobile isavailable to userson the “Power User” and “AI Expert” Setapp subscription plans for free. Otherwise, users can sign up via a new “iOS Advanced” plan that includes both the iOS app from Setapp’s main subscription andSetapp Mobileat $9.99/€9.49 monthly or $107.88/€102.48 yearly. In addition, all Setapp subscribers (except for “Family” and “Teams”) can try Setapp Mobile for free during the invite-only beta period. Fortnite maker Epic Gameslaunched its alternative iOS app storein the EU on August 16, allowing users to download games, including its own Fortnite and others like Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys, with more to come. The company said it’s also bringing its games to other alternative app stores, including AltStore PAL, which it’s now supporting via a grant, as well as Aptoide’s iOS store in the EU and ONE Store on Android. The move to launch Fortnite in the alternative iOS marketplace comes more than four years after Apple removed the game from its App Store over policy violations, ahead of Epic’s legal challenge to the alleged App Store monopoly. While U.S. courts decided that Apple was not engaged in antitrust behavior, the lawsuit didpave the way for developersto link to their own websites for a reduced commission. An alternative game store for iPhone, Lisbon-basedAptoideis an open source solution for app distribution. The company, already known for its Google Play alternative, says it scans the apps to ensure they are safe to download and install. The iOS version of the Aptoide store launched as an invite-only beta in June, so you’ll need to put your emailon a waitlistto get the access code. As a free-to-use store, Aptoide doesn’t charge its users to cover its Core Technology Fee paid to Apple, but takes a 10% to 20% commission on in-app purchases on iOS, depending on whether they were generated by the marketplace or not. Across all platforms, including Android, web, car and TV, Aptoide offers 1 million apps to its over 430 million users. A B2B-focused app store, theMobiventionmarketplace allows EU companies to distribute their internal apps that are used by employees, but can’t — or shouldn’t — be published in Apple’s App Store. The company also offers the development of a customized app marketplace for companies that want to offer employees their own app store just for their corporate apps. Larger companies can even license Mobivention’s technology to more deeply customize the app marketplace to their own needs. In March,Skichannouncedthe launch of an alternative app store for EU users which differentiates itself by offering a Tinder-like interface for app discovery. That is, users swipe right to “match” with apps they might enjoy. They can also create playlists and see what apps their friends are playing. The new store will replace Skich’s existing app and will see the company taking a 15% commission on all purchases. The store has not yet filled with apps, however. Instead, it will market the offering to developers at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) and hopes to add titles later in March.

For regular readers of TechCrunch Mobility, you may be wondering, “Why did this newsletter land in my inbox on Friday?” Folks, we’re moving days in an effort to bring you a more complete rundown of the news of the week. I spent the last week at SXSW, the annual tech, film, comedy, and music festival in Austin. I recommendscrolling through our live blogto catch up on all the transportation, AI, social media, creator economy — basically tech — news that happened during the conference. I’ve watched Austin evolve over the years with some good and bad outcomes. Protected bike lanes have been one positive development, which I appreciated as I rode a few Lime scooters and two Mod Bikes e-bikes around the city. Austin is also becoming a hub for autonomous vehicle activity with Avride headquartered there, Zoox testing on public roads, and Waymo launching a commercial robotaxi service. I was lucky enough to be matched with two Waymo robotaxis — all ride-hails occur through the Uber app, so it’s never a guarantee. I also had one coordinated match courtesy of Waymo. As I wrote earlier this week, it is absolutely wild that Waymo and Uber are working together.Here’s why. Oh, and here is what Idiscovered in my Waymo-Uber robotaxi ride. Hint: some updates to the user interface. Got a tip for us?

Senior reporter Sean O’Kane took a deep dive into a new venture firm calledLeitmotifthat’s been quietly making loads of deals for the past 16 months. The firm, which has funded around 20 startups, broadly focuses on decarbonization with a portfolio that includes EV companies, space and battery plays, and four nuclear fusion startups. That’s not the interesting part. Here’s what is: All of the money in its fund came from the Volkswagen Group.Check out the full storyabout why the German automotive giant has committed $300 million to Leitmotif’s first fund. Other deals that got my attention … Carpool Logistics, a vehicle logistics platform,raised $12 millionin a Series A funding round led by Wavecrest Growth Partners, with participation from CarMax, Impel founders Devin Daly and Michael Quigley, and automotive industry veteran David Metter. Daqus Energy, a startup working on battery materials,raised $6 millionin a seed round led by Morningside with participation from unnamed individual investors. Nirvana, an AI-based insurance platform that uses real-time driving telematics and 20 billion miles of truck driving data to build and manage insurance policies for truckers,raised $80 millionin a Series C round of funding led by General Catalyst. Lightspeed Venture Partners and Valor Equity Partners also participated. The investment values Nirvana at $830 million post-money. Northvoltfiled for bankruptcyin Sweden, the latest blow to Europe’s attempts to create a battery-manufacturing juggernaut that could rival the Chinese giants. Rivianrolled out ahands-free versionof its driver-assistance system for highway driving, which founder and CEO RJ Scaringe discussed onstage at SXSW in Austin. The new hands-free feature puts Rivian in competition with Ford and GM, which have similar hands-free systems that control steering, acceleration, and braking under certain conditions and locations. Hugging Faceteamed up with AI startup Yaak toexpand LeRobot— a collection of open AI models, datasets, and tools to help build real-world robotics systems — with a training set to allow robots and cars to navigate environments like city streets autonomously. Trucks VC general partner Reilly Brennanhad an interesting column,Don’t mistake ridehailing for AV ridehailing. Travis Kalanick, the former CEO of Uber, thinks the company’s decision toabandon its autonomous driving programwas a mistake. Reminder: Uber ATG was burning through cash when it wassold to Aurora in 2020. Waymokeeps expanding — this time inSilicon Valley. And that expansion has come withhundreds of parking tickets. TheMint 400off-road race put two EVs — a Rivian R1T truck and a Chevrolet Silverado EV ZR2 off-road race truck concept —to the test. Rad Powerlost its CEO andgained a new onein a span of a few days. President Donald Trumpsaid he will label violence against Tesla dealerships asdomestic terrorism— yet another sign of his deep support for Elon Musk. As reporterSean O’Kanenotes, “Tesla Takeovers” have been breaking out across the globe at Tesla dealerships as people protest what they see as a hostile takeover of the federal government by Musk (who is CEO of Tesla and its largest shareholder) and hisDepartment of Government Efficiency. Some of the protests have resulted in graffiti on Tesla signs, charging stations set on fire, even Molotov cocktails being thrown in one dealership’s lot. This week I tried two e-bikes from Austin-basedMod Bikes. I’ll focus on its newest one, theGroove, whichlaunched earlier this week. I spent 24 hours with theGroove, an all-electric step-through bike with a souped-up beach cruiser look and feel. The Groove existed before, but Mod Bikes discontinued it. Now it’s back and has been updated throughout, including the frame, battery, torque sensor, smart display, and motor. The bike itself is sporty and polished with lots of thoughtful details that make the$1,999 priceseem like a steal. The design is thoughtful with easy-to-read and easy-to-operate controls and an integrated bike lock that folds neatly on the frame. The Groove is a throttle and pedal assist bike, and I found it easy to switch between the various modes. I rarely relied on the throttle alone because the assist provided plenty of oomph. The bike has a payload capacity of 275 pounds and reaches a top speed of 28 miles per hour. The Groove has 50 miles of range; however, there is a dual-battery option that pops it up to 100 miles. One note, though: Wow, this bike is hefty. And while that is generally a good thing, folks should give themselves a bit of time to adjust to its weight. I also testedMod Connect, which allows users to wirelessly pair a Lumos ultra-smart helmet to sync and control turn signals directly from the bike. The connected bike helmet made me feel far more visible to drivers as I navigated the busy streets of downtown Austin. What is “This week’s wheels”? It’s a chance to learn about the different transportation products we’re testing, whether it’s an electric or hybrid car, an e-bike, or even a ride in an autonomous vehicle.

The investment would come just a couple of years after Binance’s U.S. armpleaded guiltyto violating anti-money laundering regulation. As part of that guilty plea, Binance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, paid a $4.3 billion fine and spent four months in prison back in 2023. He also agreed to step down as CEO — but remains the main shareholder in the cryptocurrency exchange. Zhao is currently the 24th richest person in the world, according toForbes’ ranking. The WSJ claims he’s been pushing for a pardon from the Trump administration. Zhao’s conviction has made it difficult for Binance to find commercial partners in the U.S. or apply for crypto licenses in Europe. “I have had no discussions of a Binance U.S. deal with … well, anyone,” Zhaosaidin a post on X refuting the WSJ’s reporting. But if discussions between Binance and representatives of the Trump family are indeed taking place, it seems to boil down to a simple question: What’s the value of a presidential pardon?

SXSW 2025: What we’re paying attention to,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/sxsw-2025-what-were-paying-attention-to/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us TechCrunch will be on the ground at SXSW 2025 — the annual tech, music, comedy, and film conference that kicked off Friday in Austin — in search of the zeitgeist of this AI-centric era. Yup, we’re one sentence in and AI has already made its entrance. And why not? A quick scan of the massive SXSW schedule illustrates that AI is on center stage in Austin — and globally. It’s worth noting that this year there seems to be an emphasis on how AI is being applied to the real world, not just speculation on what it could be. SXSW tends to reflect what the tech ecosystem of founders and backers are working on. And it often coincides with the hype cycle. Autonomous vehicles, scooter mania, crypto, psychedelics — they’ve all had their moment at SXSW. The tech portion of the annual event kicked off Friday and will run through March 13. The conference begins with several tracks that fall squarely in TechCrunch’s area of interest, including the creator economy, culture, startups, health and medtech, and energy. The AI track officially begins Sunday, but it’s already making cameos. For instance, Signal President Meredith Whittaker, who was interviewed onstage Friday, called outagentic AI as a security and privacy threat, and a health expert warned that it can bedangerous for people to be too reliant on AI for companionship. Deep tech like space and quantum computing will also make its mark at the show, as will climate, sustainability — look out for Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe’skeynote March 11— and transportation. Autonomous vehicles are back, but this time they’re on the road — not just the topic of conversation in a panel. Earlier this week, Uber and Waymo launched arobotaxi servicein Austin. The so-called “Waymo on Uber” robotaxi service is available to any member of the public who has an Uber account. And you better believe TechCrunch will be hailing those robots and talking to human Uber drivers about what they think. TechCrunch will also be talking to the VCs, founders, and industry experts at SXSW to get the pulse of how the tech world is adjusting to the Trump administration and, of course, to find the next newnewthing. We’ll also be paying attention to the numerous keynotes and interviews with tech and business luminaries, notably Alan Baratz of D-Wave Quantum, Qualcomm President and CEO Cristiano Amon, Colossal Biosciences founder Ben Lamm, and Arm CEO Rene Haas. Don’t worry, we’ll have a bit of fun, too.

Scale AI is being investigated by the US Department of Labor,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/scale-ai-is-being-investigated-by-the-us-department-of-labor/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is investigating the data-labeling startup Scale AI for compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act, TechCrunch has learned. That’s a federal law that regulates unpaid wages, misclassification of employees as contractors, and illegal retaliation against workers. The investigation has been active since at least August 2024, a document seen by TechCrunch shows. And it’s ongoing, according to a person directly familiar with the matter. The mere existence of an investigation doesn’t mean Scale AI has done anything wrong, of course, and the investigation could find in favor of the company or be dismissed. Scale AI is based in San Francisco andwas valued last year at $13.8 billion. It relies on an army of workers it categorizes as contractors to do essential AI work, like labeling images for Big Tech and other organizations. Scale AI spokesperson Joe Osborne told TechCrunch that the investigation was initiated during the previous presidential administration and that Scale AI felt that its work building, testing, and evaluating AI was misunderstood by regulators then. Osborne said that Scale AI has worked extensively with the DOL to explain its business model and that conversations have been productive. More generally, Osborne said that Scale AI brings more “flexible work opportunities in AI” to Americans than any other company and that feedback from its contributors is “overwhelmingly positive.” “Hundreds of thousands of people use our platform to showcase their skills and earn extra money,” Osborne said. Scale AI is indeed a popular gig work platform. But it has recently faced legal challenges from some ex-workers over its labor practices.Two lawsuits were filedagainst the startup — one in December 2024 and the other in January 2025 — from former workers alleging they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors instead of employees, denying them access to protections like overtime pay and sick days. Scale AI has strongly disputed the lawsuits, saying that it fully complies with the law and works to ensure its pay rates meet or surpass local living wage standards. Scale AI’s international labor practices were also the subject of an investigation by theWashington Post in 2023. Workers overseas described to the Post demanding work at low pay as contractors. The company said at the time that pay rates were continually improving. The U.S. Department of Labor’swebsitesays it is able to resolve most cases administratively but that employers who violate the law may be subject to fines and potentially imprisonment. The DOL also has the power to force employers to reclassify their workers as employees. For example, in February 2024, hotel staffing startup Qwick settled a DOL case by paying $2.1 million and announcing that all California workers performing work using the Qwick app would be classified as employees, Bloomberg Lawreported. Scale AI also appears to be among the Silicon Valley firms seeking and seeing favor with the new presidential administration. Its CEO and founder Alexandr Wang, for instance,attendedDonald Trump’s inauguration in Januarylike many other tech CEOs. More telling, Scale AI’sformer managing director, Michael Kratsios, is President Trump’s nominee as new director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios previously served as the U.S.’s chief technology officer during the first Trump administration. In this position, Kratsios will advise Trump on science and technology matters. This position has no oversight over the Department of Labor. Kratsios was part of a Senatehearingon February 25 but has not been confirmed yet. Kratsios didn’t respond to a request for comment. U.S. Department of Labor spokesperson Michael Petersen told TechCrunch that it cannot confirm or deny the existence of any investigation, per long-standing policy.

The new land will host infrastructure to complement xAI’s existing Memphis data center. “xAI’s acquisition of this property ensures we’ll remain at the forefront of AI innovation, right here in Memphis,”  xAI senior site manager Brent Mayo said in a statement. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the expansion was related to apreviously announcedlease on a 522-acre site in Memphis. xAI is hungry for AI hardware. According toreports, the startup recently built a second data center in Atlanta with $700 million worth of chips and other equipment. It alsoinkeda deal with Dell to buy $5 billion worth of GPU-packed servers. xAI uses its data centers to train and run its family of AI models, Grok. The company plans to upgrade its primary Memphis-based facility, called Colossus, to 1 million Nvidia GPUs sometime this year, up from 100,000 last year. Some residents have criticized xAI’s continued expansion in Memphis, arguing it will strain the grid andworsenthe area’s air quality. To attempt to win them over, xAI has provided the local utility with discounted Tesla-manufactured batteries and constructed a water recycling plant. Partly to fund its AI infrastructure projects, xAI is said to be discussing a $10 billion round of fundraising that would value the company at $75 billion. xAI closed itslast funding round, which topped out at $6 billion, in late 2024.

Signal President Meredith Whittaker calls out agentic AI as having ‘profound’ security and privacy issues,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/signal-president-meredith-whittaker-calls-out-agentic-ai-as-having-profound-security-and-privacy-issues/,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Signal President Meredith Whittaker warned Friday thatagentic AIcould come with a risk to user privacy. Speaking onstage at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, the advocate for secure communications referred to the use of AI agents as “putting your brain in a jar,” and cautioned that this new paradigm of computing — where AI performs tasks on users’ behalf — has a “profound issue” with both privacy and security. Whittaker explained how AI agents are being marketed as a way to add value to your life by handling various online tasks for the user. For instance, AI agents would be able to take on tasks like looking up concerts, booking tickets, scheduling the event on your calendar, and messaging your friends that it’s booked. “So we can just put our brain in a jar because the thing is doing that and we don’t have to touch it, right?,” Whittaker mused. Then she explained the type of access the AI agent would need to perform these tasks, including access to our web browser and a way to drive it as well as access to our credit card information to pay for tickets, our calendar, and messaging app to send the text to your friends. “It would need to be able to drive that [process] across our entire system with something that looks like root permission, accessing every single one of those databases — probably in the clear, because there’s no model to do that encrypted,” Whittaker warned. “And if we’re talking about a sufficiently powerful … AI model that’s powering that, there’s no way that’s happening on device,” she continued. “That’s almost certainly being sent to a cloud server where it’s being processed and sent back. So there’s a profound issue with security and privacy that is haunting this hype around agents, and that is ultimately threatening to break the blood-brain barrier between the application layer and the OS layer by conjoining all of these separate services [and] muddying their data,” Whittaker concluded. If a messaging app like Signal were to integrate with AI agents, it would undermine the privacy of your messages, she said. The agent has to access the app to text your friends and also pull data back to summarize those texts. Her comments followed remarks she made earlier during the panel on how the AI industry had been built on a surveillance model with mass data collection. She said that the “bigger is better AI paradigm” — meaning the more data, the better — had potential consequences that she didn’t think were good. With agentic AI, Whittaker warned we’d further undermine privacy and security in the name of a “magic genie bot that’s going to take care of the exigencies of life,” she concluded.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder andlongtime chief scientist Ilya SutskeverandCTO Mira Murati.OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits fromAlden Global Capital-owned newspapersalleging copyright infringement, as well asan injunction from Elon Muskto halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race toChinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up itsrelationship with Washingtonas it simultaneouslypursues an ambitious data center project,and as itreportedly lays the groundworkfor one of the largest funding rounds in history. Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check outour ChatGPT FAQ here.  OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in apost on X, that the company hastrained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.And it turns out that itmight not be that greatat creative writing at all. we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.PROMPT:Please write a metafictional literary short story… OpenAIrolled out new toolsdesignedto help developers and businesses build AI agents— automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar toOpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replacesOpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026. OpenAIintends to release several “agent” productstailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according toa report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them. The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT appallows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users. According toa new reportfrom VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT,experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024.It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from100 million in November 2023to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to300 million by December 2024and400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch. OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In apost on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model. Acommonly cited statis that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofitAI research institute Epoch AIfound the average ChatGPT queryconsumes around 0.3 watt-hours.However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing. In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicatesits step-by-step “thought” process.ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions. OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web searchwithout having to log in.While OpenAIhad previously allowedusers to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in. OpenAI announced a new AI “agent”called deep researchthat’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources. OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView tomeasure the persuasive abilitiesof its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects userposts from the subredditand asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post. OpenAI launched a newAI “reasoning” model, o3-mini,the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI firstpreviewed the model in Decemberalongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.” A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found thatover half of ChatGPT’s mobile usersare under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Govdesigned to provide U.S. government agenciesan additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data. Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork,according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center.In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm. OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator,the company’s AI “agent” tool,for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days,which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s. OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that cantake control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions.Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online. Operator,OpenAI’s agent tool,could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest thatOperator will be available as an early research previewto users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, buta user on X who goes by Choispotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website. OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT userssign up with only a phone number— no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email. ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks,allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week. OpenAI is introducing a new way for users tocustomize their interactions with ChatGPT.Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However,some users reportedthat the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely. ChatGPT Search can be fooled into generating completely misleading summaries,The Guardian has found.They found ChatGPT could be prompted to ignore negative reviews andgenerate “entirely positive” summariesby inserting hidden text into websites it created and that ChatGPT Search could also be made to spit out malicious code using this method. Microsoft and OpenAI have a veryspecific, internal definition of AGIbased on the startup’s profits, according to a newreport from The Information.The two companies reportedly signed an agreement stating OpenAI has only achieved AGI when it develops AI systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profit, which is far from the rigorous technical and philosophical definition of AGI many would expect. OpenAIreleased new researchoutlining the company’s approach to ensure AI reasoning models stay aligned with the values of their human developers. The startup used “deliberative alignment” to make o1 and o3“think” about OpenAI’s safety policy.According to OpenAI’s research, the method decreased the rate at which o1 answered “unsafe” questions while improving its ability to answer benign ones. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announcedthe successors to its o1 reasoning model family:o3 and o3-mini. The models are not widely available yet, but safety researchers can sign up for a preview. The reveal marks the end of the “12 Days of OpenAI” event, which saw announcements for real-time vision capabilities, ChatGPT Search, and even a Santa voice for ChatGPT. In an effort to make ChatGPT accessible to as many people as possible, OpenAI announceda 1-800 number to call the chatbot— even from a landline or a flip phone. Users can call 1-800-CHATGPT, and ChatGPT will respond to your queries in an experience that is more or less identical to Advanced Voice Mode — minus the multimodality. OpenAI is offering 15 minutes of free calling for U.S. users. The company notes that standard carrier fees may apply. OpenAI is bringing ChatGPT Searchto free, logged in users.Search gives ChatGPT the ability to access real-time information on the web to better answer your queries, but was only available for paid userswhen it launched in October.Not only is Search available now for free users, but it’s also been integratedinto Advanced Voice Mode. OpenAI is blaming one of the longest outages in its history on a “new telemetry service” gone awry. OpenAI wrote in a postmortem that the outage wasn’t caused by a security incident or recent product launch, but by atelemetry service it deployedto collect Kubernetes metrics. OpenAI announced that ChatGPT users could accessa new “Santa Mode” voiceduring December. The feature allows users to speak with ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, but with a Christmas twist. The voice sounds, well, “merry and bright,” as OpenAI described it. Think boomy, jolly — more or less like every Santa you’ve ever heard. OpenAI released thereal-time video capabilities for ChatGPTthat it demoed nearly seven months ago. ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro subscribers can use the app to point their phones at objects and have ChatGPT respond in near-real-time. The feature can also understand what’s on a device’s screen through screen sharing. There’s more to come from OpenAI through December 23. Tune in toour live blogto stay updated. ChatGPT and Sora both experienced a major outage Wednesday. Though users suspected the outage was due to the rollout of ChatGPT in Apple Intelligence, OpenAI developer community lead Edwin Arbusdenied it in a post on X, saying the “outage was unrelated to 12 Days of OpenAI or Apple Intelligence. We made a config change that caused many servers to become unavailable.” ChatGPT, API, and Sora were down today but we've recovered.https://t.co/OKiQYp3tXE Canvas, OpenAI’scollaboration-focused interfacefor writing and code projects, is now rolling out to all users after being in beta for ChatGPT Plus members since October 2024. The company also announced the ability to integrate Python code within Canvas as well as bringing Canvas to custom GPTs. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that due to higher than expected demand, they are pausing new sign-ups for its video generator Sora and that video generations will be slower for the time being. Thecompany released Soraas part of its “12 Days of OpenAI” event followingnearly a year of teasing the product. demand higher than expected; signups will be disabled on and off and generations will be slow for awhile.doing our best!https://t.co/JU3WxE5bGl OpenAI has finally released itstext to video model, Sora.The model can generate videos up to 20 seconds long in 1080p based on text prompts or uploaded images, and can be “remixed” through additional user prompts. Sora is available starting today toChatGPT Proand Plus subscribers (except in the EU). In Monday’s“12 Days of OpenAI” livestream,CEO Sam Altman said that ChatGPT Plus members will get 50 video generations a month, while ChatGPT Pro users will get “unlimited” generations in their “slow queue mode” and 500 “normal” generations per month. There are still more reveals to come from OpenAI through December 23. Tune in toour live blogto stay updated. On day one of its12 Days of OpenAI event,the company announced a new — and expensive — subscription plan. ChatGPT Pro is a$200-per-month tierthat provides unlimited access to all of OpenAI’s models, including the full version of its o1 “reasoning” model. The full version of o1, which wasreleased as a preview in September,can now reason about image uploads and has been trained to be “more concise in its thinking” to improve response times. Over the next few weeks, we’ll be updating all the news from OpenAI as it happenson our live blog.Follow along with us!

At the New York Times’ Dealbook Summit, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that ChatGPT hassurpassed 300 million weekly active users.The milestone comes just a few months after the chatbothit 200 million weekly active usersin August 2024 and just over a year afterreaching 100 million weekly active usersin November 2023. ChatGPT users discovered an interesting phenomenon: the popular chatbot refused to answer questionsasked about a “David Mayer,”and asking it to do so caused it to freeze up instantly. While the strange behavior spawned conspiracy theories, and a slew of other names being impacted, a much more ordinary reason may be at the heart of it:digital privacy requests. OpenAI is toying withthe idea of getting into ads.CFO Sarah Friartold the Financial Timesit’s weighing an ads business model, with plans to be “thoughtful” about when and where ads appear — though she later stressed that the company has “no active plans to pursue advertising.” Still, the exploration may raise eyebrows given that Sam Altman recently saidads would be a “last resort.” A group of Canadian media companies, including the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail,have filed a lawsuit against OpenAI.The companies behind the suit said that OpenAI infringed their copyrights and are seeking to win monetary damages — and ban OpenAI from making further use of their work. OpenAI announced that its GPT-4o model has been updated to feature more “natural” and “engaging” creative writing abilities as well as more thorough responses and insights when accessing files uploaded by users. GPT-4o got an update 🎉The model’s creative writing ability has leveled up–more natural, engaging, and tailored writing to improve relevance & readability.It’s also better at working with uploaded files, providing deeper insights & more thorough responses. ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode featureis expanding to the web,allowing users to talk to the chatbot through their browser. The conversational feature is rolling out to ChatGPT’s paying Plus, Enterprise, Teams, or Edu subscribers. Rolling out to ChatGPT paid users this week: Advanced Voice Mode on web! 😍We launched Advanced Voice Mode in our iOS and Android apps in September, and just recently brought them to our desktop apps (https://t.co/vVRYHXsbPD)—now we’re excited to add web to the mix. This means…pic.twitter.com/HtG5Km2OGh OpenAI announced the ChatGPT desktop app for macOScan now read code in a handful of developer-focused coding apps,such as VS Code, Xcode, TextEdit, Terminal, and iTerm2 — meaning that developers will no longer have to copy and paste their code into ChatGPT. When the feature is enabled, OpenAI will automatically send the section of code you’re working on through its chatbot as context, alongside your prompt. Lilian Weng announced on X thatshe is departing OpenAI.Weng served as VP of research and safety since August, and before that was the head of OpenAI’s safety systems team. It’s the latest in a long string of AIsafety researchers,policy researchers,andother executiveswho have exited the company in the last year. After working at OpenAI for almost 7 years, I decide to leave. I learned so much and now I'm ready for a reset and something new.Here is the note I just shared with the team. 🩵pic.twitter.com/2j9K3oBhPC OpenAI stated that it told around 2 million users of ChatGPT to go elsewherefor information about the 2024 U.S. election,and instead recommended trusted news sources like Reuters and the Associated Press. In a blog post, OpenAI said that ChatGPT sent roughly a million people to CanIVote.org when they asked questions specific to voting in the lead-up to the election andrejected around 250,000 requests to generate imagesof the candidates over the same period. Adding to its collection of high-profile domain names,Chat.com now redirects to ChatGPT.Last year, it was reported that HubSpot co-founder and CTO Dharmesh Shah acquired Chat.com for $15.5 million, making it one of the top two all-time publicly reported domain sales — though OpenAI declined to state how much it paid for it. https://t.co/n494J9IuEN The former head of Meta’s augmented reality glasses effortsis joining OpenAI to lead robotics and consumer hardware.Kalinowski is a hardware executive who began leadingMeta’s AR glasses teamin March 2022.

Apple is including an option to upgrade toChatGPT Plus inside its Settings app,according to an update to the iOS 18.2 betaspotted by 9to5Mac.This will give Apple users a direct route to sign up for OpenAI’s premium subscription plan, which costs $20 a month. Ina Reddit AMA,OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admitted that a lack of compute capacity is one major factor preventing the company from shipping products as often as it’d like, including the vision capabilities for Advanced Voice Modefirst teased in May.Altman also indicated that the next major release of DALL-E, OpenAI’s image generator, has no launch timeline, and thatSora, OpenAI’s video-generating tool,has also been held back. Altman also admitted tousing ChatGPT “sometimes”to answer questions throughout the AMA. OpenAIlaunched ChatGPT Search,an evolution of theSearchGPT prototypeit unveiled this summer.

OpenAI denied reports that it is intending to release anAI model, code-named Orion,by December of this year. An OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch that they “don’t have plans to release a model code-named Orion this year,” but that leaves OpenAI substantial wiggle room. OpenAI has begun previewinga dedicated Windows app for ChatGPT.The company says the app is an early version and is currently only available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu users with a “full experience” set to come later this year. OpenAI struck acontent deal with Hearst,the newspaper and magazine publisher known for the San Francisco Chronicle, Esquire, Cosmopolitan, ELLE, and others. The partnership will allow OpenAI to surface stories from Hearst publications with citations and direct links. OpenAI introduced a new way tointeract with ChatGPT called “Canvas.”The canvas workspace allows for users to generate writing or code, then highlight sections of the work to have the model edit. Canvas is rolling out in beta to ChatGPT Plus and Teams, with a rollout to come to Enterprise and Edu tier users next week. When writing code, canvas makes it easier to track and understand ChatGPT’s changes.It can also review code, add logs and comments, fix bugs, and port to other coding languages like JavaScript and Python.pic.twitter.com/Fxssd5pDl0 OpenAI hasclosed the largest VC round of all time.The startup announced it raised $6.6 billion in a funding round that values OpenAI at $157 billion post-money. Led by previous investor Thrive Capital, the new cash brings OpenAI’s total raised to $17.9 billion, per Crunchbase. At the first of its 2024 Dev Day events, OpenAIannounced a new API toolthat will let developers build nearly real-time, speech-to-speech experiences in their apps, with the choice of using six voices provided by OpenAI. These voices are distinct from those offered for ChatGPT, and developers can’t use third party voices, in order to prevent copyright issues. OpenAI is planning toraise the price of individual ChatGPT subscriptionsfrom $20 per month to $22 per month by the end of the year, according to a report from The New York Times. The report notes that a steeper increase could come over the next five years; by 2029, OpenAI expects it’ll charge $44 per month for ChatGPT Plus. OpenAI CTO Mira Murati announcedthat she is leaving the companyafter more than six years.

OpenAIunveiled a preview of OpenAI o1, also known as “Strawberry.” The collection of models are available in ChatGPT and via OpenAI’s API: o1-preview and o1 mini. The company claims that o1 can more effectively reason through math and science and fact-check itself by spending more time considering all parts of a command or question. Unlike ChatGPT, o1 can’t browse the web or analyze files yet, is rate-limited and expensive compared to other models. OpenAI says it plans to bring o1-mini access to all free users of ChatGPT, but hasn’t set a release date. OpenAI o1 codes a video game from a prompt.pic.twitter.com/aBEcehP0j8 An artist and hacker founda way to jailbreak ChatGPTto produce instructions for making powerful explosives, a request that the chatbot normally refuses.

Its ChatGPT-integrated Plus Speech voice assistant is an AI chatbot based on Cerence’s Chat Pro product and a LLM from OpenAI and will begin rolling out on September 6 with the 2025 Jetta and Jetta GLI models. As part of the new deal,OpenAI will surface stories from Condé Nast propertieslike The New Yorker, Vogue, Vanity Fair, Bon Appétit and Wired in ChatGPT and SearchGPT. Condé Nast CEO Roger Lynch implied that the “multi-year” deal will involve payment from OpenAI in some form and a Condé Nast spokesperson told TechCrunch that OpenAI will have permission to train on Condé Nast content. We’re partnering with Condé Nast to deepen the integration of quality journalism into ChatGPT and our SearchGPT prototype.https://t.co/tiXqSOTNAl TechCrunch’s Maxwell Zeff has beenplaying around with OpenAI’s Advanced Voice Mode,in what he describes as “the most convincing taste I’ve had of an AI-powered future yet.” Compared to Siri or Alexa, Advanced Voice Mode stands out with faster response times, unique answers and the ability to answer complex questions. But the feature falls short as an effective replacement for virtual assistants. OpenAI has banned a cluster of ChatGPT accountslinked to an Iranian influence operationthat was generating content about the U.S. presidential election.OpenAI identified five website frontspresenting as both progressive and conservative news outlets that used ChatGPT to draft several long-form articles, though it doesn’t seem that it reached much of an audience. OpenAI has found that GPT-4o, which powers the recently launched alpha ofAdvanced Voice Modein ChatGPT, can behave in strange ways. In a new “red teaming” report, OpenAI reveals some ofGPT-4o’s weirder quirks,like mimicking the voice of the person speaking to it or randomly shouting in the middle of a conversation. After a big jump following the release of OpenAI’snew GPT-4o “omni” model,the mobile version of ChatGPT has now seenits biggest month of revenue yet.The app pulled in $28 million in net revenue from the App Store and Google Play in July, according to data provided by app intelligence firm Appfigures. OpenAI has built a watermarking tool that could potentially catch students who cheat by using ChatGPT — butThe Wall Street Journal reportsthat the company is debating whether to actually release it. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is researching tools that can detect writing from ChatGPT, but said it’s takinga “deliberate approach” to releasing it. OpenAI is giving users their first access toGPT-4o’s updated realistic audio responses.The alpha version is now available to a small group of ChatGPT Plus users, and the company says the feature will gradually roll out to all Plus users in the fall of 2024.

Content from Reddit will be incorporated into ChatGPT, and the companies will work together to bring new AI-powered features to Reddit users and moderators. We’re partnering with Reddit to bring its content to ChatGPT and new products:https://t.co/xHgBZ8ptOE OpenAI’s spring update event saw the reveal ofits new omni model, GPT-4o,which has ablack hole-like interface, as well as voice and vision capabilities that feel eerily like something out of “Her.” GPT-4o is set to roll out “iteratively” across its developer and consumer-facing products over the next few weeks. OpenAI demos real-time language translation with its latest GPT-4o model.pic.twitter.com/pXtHQ9mKGc The company announced it’s building a tool, Media Manager, that willallow creators to better control how their content is being usedto train generative AI models — and give them an option to opt out. The goal is to have the new toolin place and ready to use by 2025. In a newpeek behind the curtain of its AI’s secret instructions, OpenAI also releaseda new NSFW policy. Though it’s intended to start a conversation about how it might allow explicit images and text in its AI products, it raises questions about whether OpenAI — or any generative AI vendor — can be trusted to handle sensitive content ethically. In a new partnership,OpenAI will get access to developer platform Stack Overflow’s APIand will get feedback from developers to improve the performance of their AI models. In return, OpenAI will include attributions to Stack Overflow in ChatGPT. However, the deal was not favorable to some Stack Overflow users —leading to some sabotaging their answer in protest. Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers, including the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, and the Denver Post,are suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement.The lawsuit alleges that the companies stole millions of copyrighted articles “without permission and without payment” to bolster ChatGPT and Copilot. OpenAI has partnered with another news publisher in Europe,London’s Financial Times, that the company will be paying for content access. “Through the partnership, ChatGPT users will be able to see select attributed summaries, quotes and rich links to FT journalism in response to relevant queries,”the FT wrote in a press release. OpenAI isopening a new office in Tokyoand has plans for a GPT-4 model optimized specifically for the Japanese language. The move underscores how OpenAI will likely need to localize its technology to different languages as it expands. According to Reuters, OpenAI’sSam Altman hosted hundreds of executivesfrom Fortune 500 companies across several cities in April, pitching versions of its AI services intended for corporate use. Premium ChatGPT users — customers paying for ChatGPT Plus, Team or Enterprise — can now usean updated and enhanced version of GPT-4 Turbo. The new model brings with it improvements in writing, math, logical reasoning and coding, OpenAI claims, as well as a more up-to-date knowledge base. Our new GPT-4 Turbo is now available to paid ChatGPT users. We’ve improved capabilities in writing, math, logical reasoning, and coding.Source:https://t.co/fjoXDCOnPrpic.twitter.com/I4fg4aDq1T You can now use ChatGPTwithout signing up for an account, but it won’t be quite the same experience. You won’t be able to save or share chats, use custom instructions, or other features associated with a persistent account. This version of ChatGPT will have “slightly more restrictive content policies,” according to OpenAI. When TechCrunch asked for more details, however, the response was unclear: “The signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience,” a spokesperson said. TechCrunch found that the OpenAI’s GPT Storeis flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs. A cursory search pulls up GPTs that claim to generate art in the style of Disney and Marvel properties, but serve as little more than funnels to third-party paid services and advertise themselves as being able to bypass AI content detection tools. In acourt filing opposing OpenAI’s motion to dismiss The New York Times’ lawsuitalleging copyright infringement, the newspaper asserted that “OpenAI’s attention-grabbing claim that The Times ‘hacked’ its products is as irrelevant as it is false.” The New York Times also claimed that some users of ChatGPT used the tool to bypass its paywalls. At a SXSW 2024 panel, Peter Deng, OpenAI’s VP of consumer product dodged a question on whetherartists whose work was used to train generative AI models should be compensated. While OpenAI lets artists “opt out” of and remove their work from the datasets that the company uses to train its image-generating models, some artists have described the tool as onerous. ChatGPT’s environmental impact appears to be massive. According to areport from The New Yorker, ChatGPT uses an estimated 17,000 times the amount of electricity than the average U.S. household to respond to roughly 200 million requests each day. OpenAI released a newRead Aloud featurefor the web version of ChatGPT as well as the iOS and Android apps. The feature allows ChatGPT to read its responses to queries in one of five voice options and can speak 37 languages, according to the company. Read aloud is available on both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models. ChatGPT can now read responses to you. On iOS or Android, tap and hold the message and then tap “Read Aloud”. We’ve also started rolling on web – click the ""Read Aloud"" button below the message.pic.twitter.com/KevIkgAFbG — OpenAI (@OpenAI)March 4, 2024  As part of a new partnership with OpenAI,the Dublin City Council will use GPT-4to craft personalized itineraries for travelers, including recommendations of unique and cultural destinations, in an effort to support tourism across Europe. New York-based law firm Cuddy Law was criticized by a judge forusing ChatGPT to calculate their hourly billing rate. The firm submitted a $113,500 bill to the court, which was then halved by District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who called the figure “well above” reasonable demands. ChatGPT users found that ChatGPT was givingnonsensical answers for several hours, prompting OpenAI to investigate the issue. Incidents varied from repetitive phrases to confusing and incorrect answers to queries. The issue was resolved by OpenAI the following morning. The dating app giant home to Tinder, Match and OkCupid announced an enterprise agreement with OpenAIin an enthusiastic press release written with the help of ChatGPT. The AI tech willbe used to help employees with work-related tasksand come as part of Match’s $20 million-plus bet on AI in 2024. As part of a test,OpenAI began rolling out new “memory” controlsfor a small portion of ChatGPT free and paid users, with a broader rollout to follow. The controls let you tell ChatGPT explicitly to remember something, see what it remembers or turn off its memory altogether. Note that deleting a chat from chat history won’t erase ChatGPT’s or a custom GPT’s memories — you must delete the memory itself. We’re testing ChatGPT's ability to remember things you discuss to make future chats more helpful. This feature is being rolled out to a small portion of Free and Plus users, and it's easy to turn on or off.https://t.co/1Tv355oa7Vpic.twitter.com/BsFinBSTbs — OpenAI (@OpenAI)February 13, 2024  Initially limited to a small subset of free and subscription users, Temporary Chat lets you have a dialogue with a blank slate. With Temporary Chat, ChatGPT won’t be aware of previous conversations or access memories but will follow custom instructions if they’re enabled. But, OpenAI says it may keep a copy of Temporary Chat conversations for up to 30 days for “safety reasons.” Use temporary chat for conversations in which you don’t want to use memory or appear in history.pic.twitter.com/H1U82zoXyC — OpenAI (@OpenAI)February 13, 2024  Paid users of ChatGPT cannow bring GPTs into a conversationby typing “@” and selecting a GPT from the list. The chosen GPT will have an understanding of the full conversation, and different GPTs can be “tagged in” for different use cases and needs. You can now bring GPTs into any conversation in ChatGPT – simply type @ and select the GPT. This allows you to add relevant GPTs with the full context of the conversation.pic.twitter.com/Pjn5uIy9NF — OpenAI (@OpenAI)January 30, 2024  Screenshots provided to Ars Technica found thatChatGPT is potentially leaking unpublished research papers, login credentials and private informationfrom its users. An OpenAI representative told Ars Technica that the company was investigating the report. OpenAI has been toldit’s suspected of violating European Union privacy, following a multi-month investigation of ChatGPT by Italy’s data protection authority. Details of the draft findings haven’t been disclosed, but in a response, OpenAI said: “We want our AI to learn about the world, not about private individuals.” In an effort to win the trust of parents and policymakers,OpenAI announced it’s partnering with Common Sense Mediato collaborate on AI guidelines and education materials for parents, educators and young adults. The organization works to identify and minimize tech harms to young people and previously flagged ChatGPT aslacking in transparency and privacy. Aftera letter from the Congressional Black Caucusquestioned the lack of diversity in OpenAI’s board, the companyresponded. The response, signed by CEO Sam Altman and Chairman of the Board Bret Taylor, said building a complete and diverse board was one of the company’s top priorities and that it was working with an executive search firm to assist it in finding talent. Ina blog post, OpenAI announced price drops for GPT-3.5’s API, with input prices dropping to 50% and output by 25%, to $0.0005 per thousand tokens in, and $0.0015 per thousand tokens out. GPT-4 Turbo also got a new preview model for API use, which includes an interesting fix thataims to reduce “laziness”that users have experienced. Expanding the platform for@OpenAIDevs: new generation of embedding models, updated GPT-4 Turbo, and lower pricing on GPT-3.5 Turbo.https://t.co/7wzCLwB1ax — OpenAI (@OpenAI)January 25, 2024  OpenAI has suspended AI startup Delphi, whichdeveloped a bot impersonating Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.)to help bolster his presidential campaign. The ban comes just weeks after OpenAI published a plan to combat election misinformation, which listed “chatbots impersonating candidates” as against its policy. Beginning in February,Arizona State University will have full access to ChatGPT’s Enterprise tier, which the university plans to use to build a personalized AI tutor, develop AI avatars, bolster their prompt engineering course and more. It marks OpenAI’s first partnership with a higher education institution. After receiving the prestigious Akutagawa Prize for her novel The Tokyo Tower of Sympathy, author Rie Kudanadmitted that around 5% of the book quoted ChatGPT-generated sentences“verbatim.”Interestingly enough, the novel revolves around a futuristic world with a pervasive presence of AI. In a conversation with Bill Gates on theUnconfuse Mepodcast, Sam Altman confirmed an upcoming release of GPT-5 that will be “fully multimodal with speech, image, code, and video support.” Altman said users can expect to see GPT-5 drop sometime in 2024. OpenAI is forming aCollective Alignment teamof researchers and engineers to create a system for collecting and “encoding” public input on its models’ behaviors into OpenAI products and services. This comes as a part of OpenAI’s public program to award grants to fund experiments in setting up a “democratic process” for determining the rules AI systems follow. In a blog post, OpenAI announcedusers will not be allowed to build applications for political campaigning and lobbying until the company works out how effective their tools are for “personalized persuasion.” Users will also be banned from creating chatbots that impersonate candidates or government institutions, and from using OpenAI tools to misrepresent the voting process or otherwise discourage voting. The company is also testing out a tool that detects DALL-E generated images and will incorporate access to real-time news, with attribution, in ChatGPT. Snapshot of how we’re preparing for 2024’s worldwide elections: • Working to prevent abuse, including misleading deepfakes• Providing transparency on AI-generated content• Improving access to authoritative voting informationhttps://t.co/qsysYy5l0L — OpenAI (@OpenAI)January 15, 2024  Inan unannounced update to its usage policy, OpenAI removed language previously prohibiting the use of its products for the purposes of “military and warfare.” In an additional statement, OpenAI confirmed that the language was changed in order to accommodate military customers and projects that do not violate their ban on efforts to use their tools to “harm people, develop weapons, for communications surveillance, or to injure others or destroy property.” Aptly called ChatGPT Team, the new plan provides a dedicated workspace for teams of up to 149 people using ChatGPT as well as admin tools for team management. In addition to gaining access to GPT-4, GPT-4 with Vision and DALL-E3, ChatGPT Team lets teams build and share GPTs for their business needs. After some back and forth over the last few months,OpenAI’s GPT Store is finally here. The feature lives in a new tab in the ChatGPT web client, and includes a range of GPTs developed both by OpenAI’s partners and the wider dev community. To access the GPT Store, users must be subscribed to one of OpenAI’s premium ChatGPT plans — ChatGPT Plus, ChatGPT Enterprise or the newly launched ChatGPT Team. the GPT store is live!https://t.co/AKg1mjlvo2 fun speculation last night about which GPTs will be doing the best by the end of today. — Sam Altman (@sama)January 10, 2024  Following a proposedban on using news publications and books to train AI chatbotsin the U.K., OpenAI submitted a plea to the House of Lords communications and digital committee. OpenAI argued that it would be “impossible” to train AI models without using copyrighted materials, and that they believe copyright law “does not forbid training.” OpenAI published a public responseto The New York Times’s lawsuit against them and Microsoft for allegedly violating copyright law, claiming that the case is without merit. In the response, OpenAI reiterates its view that training AI models using publicly available data from the web is fair use. It also makes the case that regurgitation is less likely to occur with training data from a single source and places the onus on users to “act responsibly.” We build AI to empower people, including journalists. Our position on the@nytimeslawsuit:• Training is fair use, but we provide an opt-out• ""Regurgitation"" is a rare bug we're driving to zero• The New York Times is not telling the full storyhttps://t.co/S6fSaDsfKb — OpenAI (@OpenAI)January 8, 2024  After beingdelayed in December,OpenAI plans to launch its GPT Storesometime in the coming week, according to an email viewed by TechCrunch. OpenAI says developers building GPTs will have to review the company’s updated usage policies and GPT brand guidelines to ensure their GPTs are compliant before they’re eligible for listing in the GPT Store. OpenAI’s update notably didn’t include any information on the expected monetization opportunities for developers listing their apps on the storefront. GPT Store launching next week – OpenAIpic.twitter.com/I6mkZKtgZG — Manish Singh (@refsrc)January 4, 2024  In an email,OpenAI detailed an incoming updateto its terms, including changing the OpenAI entity providing services to EEA and Swiss residents to OpenAI Ireland Limited. The move appears to be intended to shrink its regulatory risk in the European Union, where the company has been under scrutiny over ChatGPT’s impact on people’s privacy. ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startupOpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use. Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model isGPT-4o. There is a free version ofChatGPTthat only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version,ChatGPT Plus. Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies andsearch enginesare utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns. Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others maylimit the use of the AI-powered tool. Most recently,Microsoft announcedat its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startupLooking Glass utilizes ChatGPTto produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organizationSolana officially integrated the chatbotinto its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space. GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt. Yes. Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel. We will see howhandling troubling statements produced by ChatGPTwill play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry. Yes,there is a free ChatGPT mobile appfor iOS and Android users. It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words. Yes, it wasreleasedMarch 1, 2023. Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc. Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc. It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used. Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet. Yes. There aremultiple AI-powered chatbotcompetitors such asTogether, Google’sGeminiand Anthropic’sClaude, and developers arecreating open sourcealternatives. OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling outthis form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”. The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”. In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “Seeherefor instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.” Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde wheretwo users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine(meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm. An Australian mayor has publicly announcedhe may sue OpenAI for defamationdue to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service. CNET found itself in the midst of controversy afterFuturism reportedthe publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, wasaccusedof using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect. Several major school systems and colleges,including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim thatnot every educator agrees with. There have also been cases of ChatGPTaccusing individuals of false crimes. Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One isPromptBase. Another isChatX. More launch every day. Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in ourtests, they’re inconsistent at best. No. But OpenAIrecentlydisclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service. None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI isinvolvedin at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT. Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.
